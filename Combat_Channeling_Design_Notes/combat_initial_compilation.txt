The attacker will always be called Bob.  Jake is the defender. 
Please note, I include anything changing the status of either character as an
affect here,
even things like being set to 'on ground' or removing a weapon.

Stance Options:

  "aggressiveness"

    This stance option is just like in MM2, where you picked how reckless and
offensively your character
    was fighting.  Options are defensive, normal, aggressive, and reckless. 
The higher the setting,
    the more chance you have to go 'next' each turn.  This data is used in
the function "get_next_attacker".

    Defensive:
        You never attack (mod of 0).
        Normal cost per turn (mod of 1).
    Normal:
        Normal chance to attack (mod of 1).
        Normal cost per turn (mod of 1).
    Aggressive:
        Increased chance to attack (mod of 1.3).
        Increased cost per turn (mod of 1.5).
        Decreased chance to defend (mod of .8).
    Reckless:
        Increased chance to attack (mod of 1.7).
        Increased cost per turn (mod of 1.8).
        Decreased chance to defend (mod of .4).       

    Each attack form will include different text descriptions for the normal,
aggressive and reckless
    versions of the same attack.  An example:
   
    Form: Descending Slash (see form sheets)

        Normal: Bob steps towards Jake and brings his sword down in a smooth
motion towards Jake's head.
        Aggressive: Bob steps towards Jake and slashes downwards towards
Jake's head!
        Reckless: Bob leaps towards Jake, raises his weapon high and attempts
to cleave Jake's head in half!


  "follow-through"

    This stance option sets one of the damage mods.  As we noted in an
earlier conversation, just
    because a player is fighting quickly doesn't mean he is fighting to deal
substantial wounds - he
    could be haulting his blade just before touching the other person, such
as in a practice match.  The
    options are [practice, normal, extreme].  This data is used in the damage
calculation equation and
    in "get_next_attacker".

    Practice:
        Damage is reduced to nearly zero (random chance of doing a couple hps
damage).
        Normal chance to attack (mod of 1).
    Normal:
        Damage is normal (mod of 1).
        Normal chance to attack (mod of 1).
    Extreme:
        Damage is maximum (mod of 1.6).
        Decreased chance to attack (mod of.8).

Functions:

  "get_next_attacker"

    "get_next_attacker" determines whose turn it is to attack.  It calculates
an integer number for
    each legal combatant, and the highest value (with some random chance)
goes next.  If the player
    suffered a 'stumble/recover' failure (see Critical Failure section under
Structures for Attack
    Form) or a 'fall' failure, the player has lost his turn and may not
attack this turn.

    value = 100 * [endurance/max_endurance] * [blood/max_blood] * [hp/max_hp]
* [encumb mod - maybe
    (4*strength)/(5+get_worn_weight+get_wield_weight)] * [aggressiveness mod]
* [follow-through mod] *
    [WM mod] * [affect mods for later: include bonus for being a Warder,
Death Watch Guard, Aiel,
    Shadowspawn, players purchasing a 'intimidation qskill'.  -mod for
players that are stunned or
    scared.]

    We should note that for players that are channeling, encumb wouldn't play
any part in modififying
    their chance to weave an attack.  Any idea how to account for that? I
guess this isn't that big of
    a deal - what do you think?

    Include some random chance of going to the #2 person in the lineup.

   
  "is_a_hit"
   
    "is_a_hit" should check to see if this combat turn should be carried out
normally, or if it
    should be terminated early.  This might include all checks (that haven't
already been carried
    out) to make sure Bob can use the command he's trying to.  It makes sure
the chosen form can
    hit the bodypart (is it legal according to the form structure? does the
person even have that
    bodypart or has it already been chopped off? It includes outright
critical failures entirely
    due to the attacker's lack of skill and random chance.

    "is_a_hit" returns a 1 if the attack is legal (bodypart is present and
Bob can hit it).  It
    returns a 0 if, for any reason, there is no need for the rest of the
combat functions to
    be executed, because Bob has already failed to hit Jake.  If it returns a
zero because of
    a critical failure, then "get_critical_failure" is called.


  "get_critical_failure"
         
    "get_critical_failure" should examine the structure of the attack form
being used, and
    pick one of the critical failure scenarios given for that particular form
(held in its
    structure).  It passes the info there to "resolve_turn".


  "resolve turn"
   
    "resolve turn" outputs the last text that each PC sees, applies any
affects and calls any other
    functions necessary to end the combat turn.  It should call the functions
that calculate
    damage, apply loss of hitpoints, etc.  It should also take care of
affects, including
    being calling losing your weapon (if disarmed) and getting knocked over. 
It should also note
    when a bodypart has received enough damage to break it or cut it off - if
it's a critical
    bodypart, the player dies.  The player has a chance to pass out depending
on how much blood
    he's lost, and should get a message to that effect when he's lost a lot
and the chance is
    high.  Refer to struct bodypart for different fields.  I don't see a
reason to include these
    text descriptions in the attack form structure - rather, if a bodypart is
broken, we just
    say "Your <bodypart> breaks under the impact of that last blow!" or
something.  It should
    check for whether the weapon type deals poison or tainted blade damage,
or is a flame sword
    or something similar - if it deals a burn, it should output a line of
generic text saying
    "Bob's attack sears your <bodypart>!".  See the section on additional
fields for objects.

  "is_aim_ok"

    "is_aim_ok" checks to see if the bodypart being aimed for will be hit,
provided Jake's defense
    fails.  It returns a 1 if the aim is ok, else returns 0 and calls the
function "get_new_body-
    part" to determine what bodypart it /does/ hit (provided Jake fails to
defend). 
   
***************fill in equation later, ignore below.

    temp value = raw value - 100.  If temp value is negative, temp value = 1.

    value = temp value * [endurance/max_endurance] * [blood/max_blood] *
[hp/max_hp] * [encumb mod - maybe
    (4*strength)/(5+get_worn_weight+get_wield_weight)] * [aggressiveness mod]
* [follow-through mod] *
    [WM mod] * [affect mods for later: include bonus for being a Warder,
Death Watch Guard, Aiel,
    Shadowspawn, players purchasing a 'intimidation qskill'.  -mod for
players that are stunned or
    scared.]

  "get_new_bodypart"

    "get_new_bodypart" decides what bodypart the attack does hit, since
"is_aim_ok" determined
    that Bob missed what he was aiming for, but will still hit something
provided Jake fails
    to defend properly.  Refer to 'Miss Chart' for the bodypart data.


  "calculate_attacker_value"

    "calculate_attacker_value" takes the raw number for Bob's attack form and
mods it based on
    an equation I'll put in later.  Result is compared to result from
"calculate_defender_value"
    and the higher number is the victor.


  "calculate_defender_value"

    "calculate_defender_value" takes Jake's raw number for his defensive form
and mods it.
    The result is compared to the result from "calculate_attacker_value". 
Higher number wins.

  "is_critical_failure"

    "is_critical_failure is similar to "is_a_hit", and does the checks for
Jake's defense.  I'll
    add to this when I put in the structure for defense forms.


Structure for Attack Forms

  "form_type"
   
    All attacks are divided by the direction of the weapon (fist, blade,
pole, sai, whatever).
    Consequently, there are nine types, and all attacks may be classified as
only one specific type.
   
    "<-" Slash from right to left.
    "->" Slash from left to right.
    "V" Downward vertical slash.
    "^" Ascending vertical slash.
    "O" Thrust.
    "DR" Descending rightward slash (diagonal).
    "DL" Descending leftward slash (diagonal).
    "AR" Ascending rightward slash (diagonal).
    "AL" Ascending leftward slash (diagonal).

    Fancier forms where the blade moves in several directions are classified
by the final direction.
    "Nicodemus dips his blade low as he steps under your swing and counters
with a vertically ascending
    strike towards your head!" (see counter section under Critical Failures).


  "stance"

    This determines what position Bob has to be in to be able to use this
form.  There are three
    stances.  'Ground' is for forms used when Bob has been knocked down (yes,
there are attacks
    you can execute from the ground - some of the cooler ones :P). 
'Standing' is for most turns,
    when the combatants are fighting normally.  'Rest' is for when a player
is standing there and
    is 'jumped', so to speak.  Bob is presumed not to have a weapon wielded
IC.  See 'awareness'
    section.  Obviously a player isn't going to attack unless he's already
wielded his weapon,
    but this is included for 'counters' - if Jake gets a chance to counter
because Bob critically
    failed his initial attack, then he'll have to choose from the 'rest'
forms.

    0: Rest
    1: Standing/Normal
    2: Ground


  "name"

    Name of the form.  Thrust, lunge, whatever.  These are surpringly hard to
come up with. :p


  "weapon_type"

    Obviously you can't use a sword form if you're wielding a pole.  Weapons
include sword, dagger/knife,
    axe, ashangrei, staff/pole, spear, axe, whip, and mace.  While I don't
expect to code forms for all
    the weapons we can think of, it's easy enough to denote numbers for them
now, should we decide to
    get to them sometime down the road.  This should also check for right
wield, left wield, dual wield
    (two weapons) and two handed weapons.  Realistically, we only need to
code single wield swords for
    starters, since that's what almost everybody uses.  Daggers next, then
staffs. 


  "attack_type"

    This is directly attributed to the type of weapon, and if you can think
of a way to include it
    just based on weapon type, then we don't even need this field.  I think
we should eliminate the
    'piercing/crushing/slashing' option and have the weapon and the type of
form decide that.  A sword
    will always be slashing for all forms except type "O", in which case it
is piercing.  A fist and a
    pole will always be crushing damage.  If this field indicates crushing
damage, then it can stun
    you - but if it's slash or pierce damage, then it won't.


  "acceptable_bodyparts"

    Each bodypart should default to 'acceptable', but should be able to be
deselected.  This is for
    some specialized forms, such as a flat-hand to the face designed to break
your nose, or a move
    designed to break your arm or your leg.  Each bodypart should have a '1'
for acceptable, and a
    '0' if unacceptable. 


  "auto-affects"

    This is for any affects that occur regardless of whether the attack is
successful or not.  Bob
    could jump in the air, feet forward, and try and knock Jake down with the
impact of his boots.
    If successful, Jake is set to 'on ground', but either way, Bob is set to
'on ground'.

    0: Set Bob on ground
    1: Remove Bob's weapon to ground
    2: etc?


  "successful-affects"
   
    This is for affects that are carried out if the form is successful, such
as blindness, getting
    knocked down, Bob losing his weapon (such as throwing a knife) or Jake
losing his weapon (such
    as in a disarm).  Some forms (especially unarmed ones) are designed
specifically to break
    limbs, so if they're successful, the limb should be set to broken.

    0: No affects
    1: Blind
    2: Set Broken
    3: Remove Bob's weapon to ground
    4: Remove Bob's weapon to Jake's inventory
    5: Remove Jake's weapon to ground
    6: Remove Jake's weapon to Bob's inventory
    7: Set Bob on ground

 
  "Area_is_allowed"

    I thought we could treat this similarly to how the bitvectors identify
the type of room you're
    in.  For instance, some forms could only work in rooms denoted as a ship,
or in cities.  That
    way the text descriptions could be more colorful - people could be
described as using their
    surroundings to their advantage, though this would be most useful under
Defense Forms ("Rasridim
    sidesteps quickly and puts the mainmast between you - your blade cuts
into the wood, but you
    yank it out quickly.")


  "teachable"

    If a PC has the form, can he teach it to another PC?


  "learnable"

    If a PC is defending against a PC or a mob with this form, can he learn
it just from defending
    against it in combat?


  "is_standard"

    This is for quick-setting of players with forms for their WM level.  If
it is a standard form,
    then setting them with the right tier of WM would give them the proper
tier of all forms of
    this type.  If the form is not standard, i.e. exotic (like something a
grolm or a shadowspawn
    would do), then it would not be set.  This was more of an idea, and not a
huge deal.  Maybe
    you could just put the field in the structure for now and we'll do the
supporting code later?

  "aggressiveness: normal init text"

    This is the first line of text that PCs see when Bob's aggressive stance
is normal.
   
    "Bob sweeps his weapon left in a short, smooth stroke aimed at your
<bodypart>"

  "aggressiveness: aggressive init text"

    This is the first line of text that PCs see when Bob's stance is
aggressive.

    "Bob drives forward towards you quickly, sweeping his sword leftward in
an attempt to slash at
    your <bodypart>."

  "aggressiveness: reckless init text"

    Bob's stance is reckless.

    "Bob wheels about and slashes violently leftward, bringing his sword
around himself as he
    corkscrews recklessly but with enormous power."

  "minor wound"

    This is the description of what happens when Bob succeeds in his attack,
and deals only
    minor damage.  Recall the bodypart structure.

    "Bob's slash cuts Jake's <bodypart>."

  "substantial wound"

    This is the description for a substantial wound dealt by this attack.
    "Bob slashes Jake's <bodypart> - it starts bleeding badly."

  "gashed wound"

    "Jake's arm sprays blood as Bob deals him an awful gash!"
 
  "Critical Failures"

    There are multiple types of critical failures, arranged by their affects.
A single attack
    form may have several ways it can critically fail, of the same type -
there could be two
    or three different text descriptions for how he drops his weapon, for
example.

    There are five major types of critical failures that I can think of. 

    'penalty-free' failures include things like "Bob almost loses his grip on
his sword -
    he backs off quickly to recover his grip." Whoever gets to go next is
chosen normally - neither
    Bob nor Jake suffers a mod because of this critical failure.  It simply
means that Bob
    doesn't hit Jake entirely because Bob messed up on his own. 

    'loss-of-weapon' failures include situations like "Bob's weapon slips
from his hands!
    The sword flies off to one side, landing harmlessly on the ground and
leaving Bob
    unarmed." Any failures included of this type would remove the weapon and
load it
    onto the ground.

    'stumble/recover' failures include all situations where Bob fails to
properly
    execute the attack, and even though he doesn't suffer any direct ill
affects like dropping
    his weapon or falling, he loses his chance to attack again.

    'fall' failures include situations which result in Bob ending up on the
ground.  Obviously
    he loses his chance to attack this turn, as with 'stumble/recover'
failures.  Any fall
    failures automatically put Bob on the ground, same as if he had failed to
bash and
    fallen down in MM2.

    'counters' are not actually failures, but I think it makes a lot of sense
to include
    them here.  The attack is assumed to fail outright, and Jake
automatically attacks back.
    The text is written such that it looks to the PCs like Bob tried to
attack, Jake stopped
    him and launched his own counter-attack.  An example:

    Bob raises his weapon high and lunges forward! (standard description for
this attack)
    "is_a_hit" returns a 0, and calls "get_critical_failure", which selects a
counter.
    Jake sees an opportunity as Bob raises his weapon too high! (this is
stored under critical failures
        for this particular attack)
    There is a greatly decreased chance to block a counter, but all the steps
for the turn
        are calculated beginning with "is_a_hit" all over again, with Jake as
the attacker. 
        Combat is resolved with the text messages stored in Jake's attack
form structure.
        "Jake runs Bob through in a smooth, pronated stroke!"

    End of example.
   
    In this way, critical failures could result in the appearance of both
players going back
    and forth for several turns, countering each other until one of them has
"is_a_hit" return
    something a 1, in which case the defender has a chance to defend at a
greatly decreased
    chance of success, and then the turn is ended (even though it really
consisted of several
    incomplete turns).  I can do a lot with this by adding multiple
descriptions of
    counters for each form.

Object fields:

  "special_damage"

    This should be a numerical value where the number is associated with the
type of additional
    affect if the attack is successful.  Most of these don't need to do
anything now - lets just
    reserve numbers so we can add the code later.  I guess some weapons could
be more than one,
    so we should just be able to add numbers to this field, the same as you
might stack things like
    '!steal' and '!donate' to an object.

    0: Normal weapon
    1: Fade blade
    2: Power-forged weapon
    3: Poisoned (HP reduction)
    4: Poisoned (Large HP reduction)
    5: Poisoned (!channeling - we'll do this later, for now just reserve a
number)
    6: Poisoned (more channeling reduction - again, just leave a number)
    7: Poisoned (Endurance reduction)
    8: Poisoned (Knock unconscious)
    9: Burn Damage
      10: Cold Damage
      11: Numb Damage
      12: Reserved for imm weapons
      13: Reserved for imm weapons
The attacker will always be called Bob.  Jake is the defender. 
Please note, I include anything changing the status of either character as an affect here,
even things like being set to 'on ground' or removing a weapon.

Stance Options:

  "aggressiveness"

    This stance option is just like in MM2, where you picked how reckless and offensively your character

        Normal chance to attack (mod of 1).
        Normal cost per turn (mod of 1).
    Aggressive:
        Increased chance to attack (mod of 1.3).
        Increased cost per turn (mod of 1.5).
        Decreased chance to defend (mod of .8).
    Reckless:
        Increased chance to attack (mod of 1.7).
        Increased cost per turn (mod of 1.8).
        Decreased chance to defend (mod of .4).           

    Each attack form will include different text descriptions for the normal, aggressive and reckless
    versions of the same attack.  An example:
   
    Form: Descending Slash (see form sheets)

        Normal: Bob steps towards Jake and brings his sword down in a smooth motion towards Jake's head.
        Aggressive: Bob steps towards Jake and slashes downwards towards Jake's head!

  "is_a_hit"
   
    "is_a_hit" should check to see if this combat turn should be carried out normally, or if it
    should be terminated early.  This might include all checks (that haven't already been carried
    out) to make sure Bob can use the command he's trying to.  It makes sure the chosen form can

    "calculate_attacker_value" takes the raw number for Bob's attack form and mods it based on
    an equation I'll put in later.  Result is compared to result from "calculate_defender_value"
    and the higher number is the victor.


  "calculate_defender_value"

    "calculate_defender_value" takes Jake's raw number for his defensive form and mods it.
    The result is compared to the result from "calculate_attacker_value".  Higher number wins.

  "is_critical_failure"

    "is_critical_failure is similar to "is_a_hit", and does the checks for Jake's defense.  I'll
    add to this when I put in the structure for defense forms.


Structure for Attack Forms

  "form_type"
   
    All attacks are divided by the direction of the weapon (fist, blade, pole, sai, whatever).
    Consequently, there are nine types, and all attacks may be classified as only one specific type.
   
    "<-" Slash from right to left.
    "->" Slash from left to right.
    "V" Downward vertical slash.
    "^" Ascending vertical slash.
    "O" Thrust.
    "DR" Descending rightward slash (diagonal).
    "DL" Descending leftward slash (diagonal).
    "AR" Ascending rightward slash (diagonal).
    "AL" Ascending leftward slash (diagonal).

    Fancier forms where the blade moves in several directions are classified by the final direction.
    "Nicodemus dips his blade low as he steps under your swing and counters with a vertically ascending
    strike towards your head!" (see counter section under Critical Failures).


  "stance"

    This determines what position Bob has to be in to be able to use this form.  There are three
    stances.  'Ground' is for forms used when Bob has been knocked down (yes, there are attacks
    you can execute from the ground - some of the cooler ones :P).  'Standing' is for most turns,
    when the combatants are fighting normally.  'Rest' is for when a player is standing there and
    is 'jumped', so to speak.  Bob is presumed not to have a weapon wielded IC.  See 'awareness'
    section.  Obviously a player isn't going to attack unless he's already wielded his weapon,
    but this is included for 'counters' - if Jake gets a chance to counter because Bob critically
    failed his initial attack, then he'll have to choose from the 'rest' forms.

    0: Rest
    1: Standing/Normal
    2: Ground


  "name"

    Name of the form.  Thrust, lunge, whatever.  These are surpringly hard to come up with. :p


  "weapon_type"

    Obviously you can't use a sword form if you're wielding a pole.  Weapons include sword, dagger/knife,
    axe, ashangrei, staff/pole, spear, axe, whip, and mace.  While I don't expect to code forms for all
    the weapons we can think of, it's easy enough to denote numbers for them now, should we decide to
    get to them sometime down the road.  This should also check for right wield, left wield, dual wield
    (two weapons) and two handed weapons.  Realistically, we only need to code single wield swords for
    starters, since that's what almost everybody uses.  Daggers next, then staffs. 


  "attack_type"

    This is directly attributed to the type of weapon, and if you can think of a way to include it
    just based on weapon type, then we don't even need this field.  I think we should eliminate the
    'piercing/crushing/slashing' option and have the weapon and the type of form decide that.  A sword
    will always be slashing for all forms except type "O", in which case it is piercing.  A fist and a
    pole will always be crushing damage.  If this field indicates crushing damage, then it can stun
    you - but if it's slash or pierce damage, then it won't.


  "acceptable_bodyparts"

    Each bodypart should default to 'acceptable', but should be able to be deselected.  This is for
    some specialized forms, such as a flat-hand to the face designed to break your nose, or a move
    designed to break your arm or your leg.  Each bodypart should have a '1' for acceptable, and a
    '0' if unacceptable. 


  "auto-affects"

    This is for any affects that occur regardless of whether the attack is successful or not.  Bob
    could jump in the air, feet forward, and try and knock Jake down with the impact of his boots.
    If successful, Jake is set to 'on ground', but either way, Bob is set to 'on ground'.

    0: Set Bob on ground
    1: Remove Bob's weapon to ground
    2: etc?


  "successful-affects"
   
    This is for affects that are carried out if the form is successful, such as blindness, getting
    knocked down, Bob losing his weapon (such as throwing a knife) or Jake losing his weapon (such
    as in a disarm).  Some forms (especially unarmed ones) are designed specifically to break
    limbs, so if they're successful, the limb should be set to broken.

    0: No affects
    1: Blind
    2: Set Broken
    3: Remove Bob's weapon to ground
    4: Remove Bob's weapon to Jake's inventory
    5: Remove Jake's weapon to ground
    6: Remove Jake's weapon to Bob's inventory
    7: Set Bob on ground

 
  "Area_is_allowed"

    I thought we could treat this similarly to how the bitvectors identify the type of room you're
    in.  For instance, some forms could only work in rooms denoted as a ship, or in cities.  That
    way the text descriptions could be more colorful - people could be described as using their
    surroundings to their advantage, though this would be most useful under Defense Forms ("Rasridim
    sidesteps quickly and puts the mainmast between you - your blade cuts into the wood, but you
    yank it out quickly.")


  "teachable"

    If a PC has the form, can he teach it to another PC?


  "learnable"

    If a PC is defending against a PC or a mob with this form, can he learn it just from defending
    against it in combat?


  "is_standard"

    This is for quick-setting of players with forms for their WM level.  If it is a standard form,
    then setting them with the right tier of WM would give them the proper tier of all forms of
    this type.  If the form is not standard, i.e. exotic (like something a grolm or a shadowspawn
    would do), then it would not be set.  This was more of an idea, and not a huge deal.  Maybe
    you could just put the field in the structure for now and we'll do the supporting code later?

  "aggressiveness: normal init text"

    This is the first line of text that PCs see when Bob's aggressive stance is normal.
   
    "Bob sweeps his weapon left in a short, smooth stroke aimed at your <bodypart>"

  "aggressiveness: aggressive init text"

    This is the first line of text that PCs see when Bob's stance is aggressive.

    "Bob drives forward towards you quickly, sweeping his sword leftward in an attempt to slash at
    your <bodypart>."

  "aggressiveness: reckless init text"

    Bob's stance is reckless.

    "Bob wheels about and slashes violently leftward, bringing his sword around himself as he
    corkscrews recklessly but with enormous power."

  "minor wound"

    This is the description of what happens when Bob succeeds in his attack, and deals only
    minor damage.  Recall the bodypart structure.

    "Bob's slash cuts Jake's <bodypart>."

  "substantial wound"

    This is the description for a substantial wound dealt by this attack.
    "Bob slashes Jake's <bodypart> - it starts bleeding badly."

  "gashed wound"

    "Jake's arm sprays blood as Bob deals him an awful gash!"
 
  "Critical Failures"

    There are multiple types of critical failures, arranged by their affects.  A single attack
    form may have several ways it can critically fail, of the same type - there could be two
    or three different text descriptions for how he drops his weapon, for example.

    There are five major types of critical failures that I can think of. 

    'penalty-free' failures include things like "Bob almost loses his grip on his sword -
    he backs off quickly to recover his grip." Whoever gets to go next is chosen normally - neither
    Bob nor Jake suffers a mod because of this critical failure.  It simply means that Bob
    doesn't hit Jake entirely because Bob messed up on his own. 

    'loss-of-weapon' failures include situations like "Bob's weapon slips from his hands!
    The sword flies off to one side, landing harmlessly on the ground and leaving Bob
    unarmed." Any failures included of this type would remove the weapon and load it
    onto the ground.

    'stumble/recover' failures include all situations where Bob fails to properly
    execute the attack, and even though he doesn't suffer any direct ill affects like dropping
    his weapon or falling, he loses his chance to attack again.

    'fall' failures include situations which result in Bob ending up on the ground.  Obviously
    he loses his chance to attack this turn, as with 'stumble/recover' failures.  Any fall
    failures automatically put Bob on the ground, same as if he had failed to bash and
    fallen down in MM2.

    'counters' are not actually failures, but I think it makes a lot of sense to include
    them here.  The attack is assumed to fail outright, and Jake automatically attacks back.
    The text is written such that it looks to the PCs like Bob tried to attack, Jake stopped
    him and launched his own counter-attack.  An example:

    Bob raises his weapon high and lunges forward! (standard description for this attack)
    "is_a_hit" returns a 0, and calls "get_critical_failure", which selects a counter.
    Jake sees an opportunity as Bob raises his weapon too high! (this is stored under critical failures
        for this particular attack)
    There is a greatly decreased chance to block a counter, but all the steps for the turn
        are calculated beginning with "is_a_hit" all over again, with Jake as the attacker. 
        Combat is resolved with the text messages stored in Jake's attack form structure.
        "Jake runs Bob through in a smooth, pronated stroke!"

    End of example.
   
    In this way, critical failures could result in the appearance of both players going back
    and forth for several turns, countering each other until one of them has "is_a_hit" return
    something a 1, in which case the defender has a chance to defend at a greatly decreased
    chance of success, and then the turn is ended (even though it really consisted of several
    incomplete turns).  I can do a lot with this by adding multiple descriptions of
    counters for each form.

Object fields:

  "special_damage"

    This should be a numerical value where the number is associated with the type of additional
    affect if the attack is successful.  Most of these don't need to do anything now - lets just
    reserve numbers so we can add the code later.  I guess some weapons could be more than one,
    so we should just be able to add numbers to this field, the same as you might stack things like
    '!steal' and '!donate' to an object.

    0: Normal weapon
    1: Fade blade
    2: Power-forged weapon
    3: Poisoned (HP reduction)
    4: Poisoned (Large HP reduction)
    5: Poisoned (!channeling - we'll do this later, for now just reserve a number)
    6: Poisoned (more channeling reduction - again, just leave a number)
    7: Poisoned (Endurance reduction)
    8: Poisoned (Knock unconscious)
    9: Burn Damage
      10: Cold Damage
      11: Numb Damage
