# Rules Index

This index provides semantic rule discovery for AI agents. All rules in `rules/` are production-ready and deployment-ready.

**How to Use This Index:**
- Browse by domain section (Core, Snowflake, Python, Shell, etc.)
- Search Keywords field for semantic discovery (technologies, patterns, use cases)
- Check Depends field for prerequisite rules


**For AI Agents:**
- This file is **READ-ONLY** for rule discovery purposes
- Use `grep`, `read_file`, or codebase_search to find relevant rules
- **Never modify** this file during task execution
- Regeneration happens automatically via `task index:generate`
- To suggest improvements, modify source rule files or `scripts/index_generator.py`


## Rule Loading Strategy

AI agents should follow this algorithm when loading rules:

### 1. Foundation (Always Load)
```
Load: rules/000-global-core.md
```

### 2. Domain Rules (File Extension Match)
Based on files mentioned in user request:
- `.py`, `.pyi`, `pyproject.toml` → Load `rules/200-python-core.md`
- `.sql` → Load `rules/100-snowflake-core.md`
- `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh` → Load `rules/300-bash-scripting-core.md`
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` → Load `rules/350-docker-best-practices.md`
- `.md` (in `rules/`) → Load `rules/002-rule-governance.md`
- `.md` (outside `rules/`, e.g., README, CONTRIBUTING) → Load `rules/202-markup-config-validation.md`
- `.ts`, `.tsx` → Load `rules/430-typescript-core.md`
- `.js`, `.jsx` → Load `rules/420-javascript-core.md`
- `.go` → Load `rules/600-golang-core.md`

### 3. Activity Rules (Keyword Match)
Use `grep -i "KEYWORD" RULES_INDEX.md` to search Keywords column:
- **test**, pytest, coverage → Consider `rules/206-python-pytest.md`
- **lint**, format, code quality → Consider `rules/201-python-lint-format.md`
- **deploy**, CI/CD, automation → Consider `rules/820-taskfile-automation.md`
- **streamlit**, dashboard → Consider `rules/101-snowflake-streamlit-core.md`
- **docker**, container → Consider `rules/350-docker-best-practices.md`
- **agent**, cortex agent → Consider `rules/115-snowflake-cortex-agents-core.md`
- **semantic view** → Consider `rules/106-snowflake-semantic-views-core.md`

### 4. Check Dependencies
- For each rule to be loaded, read its **Depends On** column
- Load all prerequisite rules first (in dependency order)
- If rule lists multiple dependencies, load all of them

### 5. Token Budget Management
**Progressive Loading Strategy:**
- **Minimal**: Foundation + Domain = ~3,000-5,000 tokens (covers 70-80% of tasks)
- **Standard**: + 1-2 activity-specific rules = ~8,000-12,000 tokens
- **Complete**: + specialized rules = ~15,000-20,000 tokens

**Token Budget Check:**

**Warning Threshold:** At 15,000 tokens, begin deferring Low-tier rules and evaluate Medium-tier necessity.

**Example - At 17,000 tokens:**
```
Loaded (Critical/High):
- 000-global-core.md, 200-python-core.md, 206-python-pytest.md

Deferred (Medium/Low - available if needed):
- 204-python-docs-comments.md (not required for test execution)
```

If total exceeds 20,000 tokens, prioritize by ContextTier:
1. Critical (always load)
2. High (load if directly relevant)
3. Medium (defer unless task complexity requires)
4. Low (load only if explicitly needed)

**Token Budget Enforcement:**
- Agent self-regulates token budget (no external enforcement)
- At 15,000 tokens: Log warning, begin deferring Low/Medium tier rules
- At 20,000 tokens: STOP loading additional rules, proceed with loaded rules only

**Deferral Priority (when at warning threshold):**
1. Defer all Low tier rules first
2. Defer Medium tier rules not directly related to task keywords
3. Never defer Critical tier rules

**Declaration Format (when deferring):**
```markdown
## Rules Loaded
- rules/000-global-core.md (foundation)
- rules/200-python-core.md (file extension: .py)
- [Deferred: 204-python-docs-comments.md - Low tier, not required for task]
```

### 6. Declare Loaded Rules
After loading, list all rules in response:
```markdown
## Rules Loaded
- rules/000-global-core.md (foundation)
- rules/200-python-core.md (file extension: .py)
- rules/206-python-pytest.md (keyword: test)
```

**Example Workflow:**

User: "Write tests for my Streamlit dashboard"

**Rule Selection:**
- Extension `.py` → rules/200-python-core.md
- Keyword "test" → rules/206-python-pytest.md
- Keyword "Streamlit" → rules/101-snowflake-streamlit-core.md
- Dependency check: 101 requires rules/100-snowflake-core.md

**Token Budget:** 000 (3300) + 200 (1800) + 206 (3500) + 100 (1800) + 101 (3700) = 14,100 ✓

**Declaration:**
```markdown
## Rules Loaded
- rules/000-global-core.md (foundation)
- rules/200-python-core.md (file extension: .py)
- rules/100-snowflake-core.md (dependency of 101)
- rules/101-snowflake-streamlit-core.md (keyword: Streamlit)
- rules/206-python-pytest.md (keyword: test)
```

## Common Rule Dependency Chains

Two representative examples demonstrating all dependency patterns. Apply these patterns to other rule combinations using the Depends field in the catalog above.

**Reading the Chains:**
- Indentation shows dependency relationships
- Token budgets shown in parentheses
- "Minimal/Standard/Complete" shows progressive loading strategies

### Example 1: Linear Chain (Streamlit Dashboard)

**`000-global-core.md`** (3300 tokens) - Foundation
- **`100-snowflake-core.md`** (2850 tokens) - Snowflake foundation
  - **`101-snowflake-streamlit-core.md`** (3700 tokens) - Streamlit core
    - **`101a-snowflake-streamlit-visualization.md`** (3600 tokens) - Visualization
    - **`101b-snowflake-streamlit-performance.md`** (5950 tokens) - Performance
    - **`101c-snowflake-streamlit-security.md`** (2550 tokens) - Security

**Token Cost Scenarios:**
- Minimal (basic app): 000 + 100 + 101 = ~9,850 tokens
- Standard (with viz): + 101a = ~13,450 tokens
- Complete (production-ready): + 101b + 101c = ~21,950 tokens

### Example 2: Multi-Branch (Cortex Agent)

**`000-global-core.md`** (3300 tokens) - Foundation
- **`100-snowflake-core.md`** (2850 tokens) - Snowflake foundation
  - **`106-snowflake-semantic-views-core.md`** (5550 tokens) - Semantic views
  - **`111-snowflake-observability-core.md`** (4200 tokens) - Observability
- **`115-snowflake-cortex-agents-core.md`** (4650 tokens) - Cortex agents
  - **`115a-snowflake-cortex-agents-instructions.md`** (3450 tokens) - Instructions
  - **`115b-snowflake-cortex-agents-operations.md`** (3650 tokens) - Operations

**Token Cost Scenarios:**
- Minimal (agent setup): 000 + 100 + 115 = ~10,800 tokens
- Standard (+ semantic): + 106 = ~16,350 tokens
- Production (+ ops): + 115b + 111 = ~24,200 tokens

**Usage Tips:**
- "Minimal" covers 70-80% of typical use cases
- Start minimal, add rules as complexity requires
- Check Depends field for prerequisites
