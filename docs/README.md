# Project Docs (Non-memory-bank)

This folder contains **durable reference documentation** that is intentionally **not** constrained by the memory bank size limits.

The `memory-bank/` folder remains focused on:
- Progress tracking
- Active context / current decisions
- Short pointers into longer docs

## Index
- `docs/db/` – Database schema + data inventories (combat/channeling)
- `docs/agents/` – Agent workflow docs (parallel safety, ports, isolated worktrees)
- `docs/mm2/` – MM2 nostalgia extraction artifacts and notes
