All building is to be done on the Builderport and will then be
copied to the live MUD by myself. Have fun on Builderport. It
won't affect what we do here, with a few exceptions.

On the bp, you will be restricted to the zones your working
on, call it a precaution if you like, distrust if your a cynic :p
Mort builders are now -`2paid`7- *pauses for the cheering* Rewards
are still being worked out, but it will be in the area of a 
qp or half a qp for every room done, and doubled for excellent ones
This, however, may change to being based on areas done, or simple
projects for those fellars who are doubling up on one area,
I haven't decided. But what it does mean, is do work, and you 
can get loaded up with a substantial number of qps.

Everyone, you MUST type:
`1redit save zone#`7 - if you have made changes to rooms
`1zedit save zone # `7- if you have made changes to zon files
`1oedit save zone # `7- if you have made changes to objects
In short, remember to type OLC often, and if you haven't
saved in awhile, do so, you don't want all your work to go down
the drain.

If you crash the bp.. Tell me, you'll get a gremlin doll as
a reward :) Don't go about trying to though *peer*

Room grid sizes are now OLC'able.
Allowed grid sizes range from 2x2 to 20x20, and only even
numbers are allowed.
In addition to that, I'll make standard indoors rooms 8x8 and
standard outdoor rooms 10x10. 
The rooms don't have to be square, but make their size IC
if you leave it at 0,0. Nothing can get in, and the room
is useless.
Also, remember. Make -sure- you use all appropriate
room flags that are IC for that room, and not to use ones
that are not appropriate. There are tidbits of code
that go off these things.

The Builders Egroup is `2builders-mit@yahoogroups.com`7, If you're not on it,
send me a mail with your email address, and I'll add you.
`1*Important*`7 Your name on the bp _MUST_ be different
than any name you would use on the live mud, if its not
tell me immediately.

Any and all room descs need to be wrapped somewhere between
75 and 80 chars, no exceptions. This is merely for neatness
and some form of continuity from zone to zone. So, when
designing rooms, take this into consideration, especially
when using color as the color charachters used don't
count towards the 75-80 chars.
If you have any questions, just hollar them my way.

`3Telepathy-`0
`0
`7As most know a Wolfkin's primary mental enhancement is the ability to`0
`7speak mentally with wolves. This communication is not done in the form`0
`7of words, so please do not RP it that way. Wolfkin and wolves`0
`7communicate by means of transmitting images and sensations. No wolf`0
`7will use images or terms which are connected to human lifestyle. They`0
`7aren't going to use an image of two men exchanging things to represent`0
`7trade or commerce and they aren't going to understand it if such an`0
`7image is sent to them. Keep that in mind when creating your images`0
`7to use in RP, or wolfnames. If an image is especially complex or`0
`7difficult to word or understand then you may use some OOC explaination`0
`7to define it's linguistic interpretation and equivalence. A character`0
`7of the subrank Young will be able to communicate in this way over a`0
`7distance of approximately a mile, someone of Respected or higher may`0
`7be able to reach distances of 2 miles. No Wolfkin can use this means`0
`7of communication to speak telepathicly with anything or anyone other`0
`7then a wolf within range or a dog with much wolf blood at a greatly`0
`7reduced vocabulary and clarity. Remember the policy surrounding how`0
`7wolves are to be Roleplayed when using this ability.`0
`0
`3Shared experience-`0
`0
`7A sort of offshoot of the telepathic talking between Wolfkin and wolves`0
`7is the ability for a Wolfkin to experience things from the perception`0
`7of a wolf within mental communication range. A prime example of this`0
`7ability in the books is during the run from the ravens to the abandoned`0
`7Stedding with Perrin, Egwene, and Elyas. What his ability means is that`0
`7a Wolfkin can effectively look through the eyes of a wolf and see what`0
`7the wolf sees, smell what he smells, taste what he tastes, and so on.`0
`7A Wolfkin can not eavesdrop on the wolf's thoughts in this manner`0
`7though, it is a purely sensory experience. The exact means of this`0
`7ability is not clear, it is uncertain whether the Wolfkin's mental`0
`7state moves to the wolf, or if the wolf is simply sending back it's`0
`7experiences and perceptions verbatim like a long conversation. Either`0
`7way though act under the assumption that the wolf must give permission`0
`7for this ability, and that you are going to be at a greatly reduced`0
`7awareness to your own physical environment. Think of it like a vitual`0
`7reality helmet....it will override for the most part all of the senses`0
`7you have involved, though you may with focus and concentration keep`0
`7some awareness of what happens around you. Sufficient not to be`0
`7blindsided or entirely oblivious. Don't be holding a conversation while`0
`7doing this though, or expect to pick up anything casual.`0
`0
`3Instincts-`0
`0
`7Perhaps the most detrimental aspect of being a Wolfkin is the`0
`7sublimation of normal human tendencies by those of a wolf. A Wolfkin`0
`7is in a near constant battle to maintain a balance between the logical`0
`7human nature and the more primal animal drives and instincts of a`0
`7wolf. Most Wolfkin exibit this in some form or other, displaying some`0
`7tendencies which are wolflike or uncommon. Sniffing the air, the way`0
`7they walk or move, growling, looks or attitudes and so on. The more`0
`7a Wolfkin experiences a raw emotion the more they may display the`0
`7attitude of a wolf and be overwhelmed by a wolf's instinctual drives.`0
`7A prime example of this is Perrin's battle with the fade, the`0
`7combination of fear, anger and adrenaline allowed him to lose much of`0
`7his control to the wolf mindset, almost to the point where he was`0
`7going to attack the Myrddraal with his teeth. The struggle between`0
`7a Wolfkin's human and wolf mindset's is most difficult for newer`0
`7Wolfkin, a balance much harder to find and the rawer more driven`0
`7instincts of a wolf hard to fathom of control. Older Wolfkin tend to`0
`7have found a means of walking the line between the two, but even they`0
`7are very susceptible to being overwhelmed by the wolf in heightened`0
`7situations. It takes effort, concentration, experience and ability`0
`7to keep from being overwhelmed by wolf instincts. No Wolfkin, none,`0
`7will manage to accomplish this completely or at all times. Every`0
`7Wolfkin should consider some means of both exibiting wolf tendencies`0
`7and justifying how and why they do not become completely absorbed and`0
`7lost. For example my character, Dugoth, not only has experience and`0
`7control but he has distinctly seperated things in his life. When he`0
`7hunts he tends to give himself largely to the wolf, examining it and`0
`7learning it as he does, letting it have a vent so they don't build up`0
`7and explode. He has also mentally set cities and libraries as rawly`0
`7human things. When reading a book or studying he is as human as he`0
`7could ever be, no aspect of i

Shadowspawn they are playing. Subranks may change as time progresses.

The first subrank everyone will receive upon joining the guild is
`1Pending`7. This period lasts for two weeks or two assignments,
whichever is completed first. Anytime during these first two weeks
the player maybe removed from the shadowspawn for any reason that
the Shadow Dept imms feel is neccesary.

After this, subranks very based upon which spawn is being played.

Trollocs will be assigned a tribe (for IC purposes, to amuse those
who can identify such things a la Lan/Moiraine from book 1), with
the option to earn "Fist Chief" eventually, although such a designation
would be saved for major war quests.

Greyman will have a choice of a few different subranks, based upon
what they wish to focus upon in their assignments (an assassin, for
example, may wish to have the subrank "Assassin", or one who merely
gathers information, could perhaps have "Stalker").

Fades may be assigned to a group of Trollocs (either PC or NPC)
and be given a "Linked Fist" designation, which would then be
shared with all trollocs under its command.

If a Shadowspawn member proves to be exemplary in their RP as a
Spawn and in their OOC behavior when involved in events and scenes
with *cough* less than appriciable players, they may earn the rank
of `1Proven`7, which will then always be a part of the rank (not
subrank) in the guild.

Please note that there is no hierarchy within the players of this
guild. The Shadow Dept Imms are the end all, be all. What they
say, goes. All mortal members of the guild are considered the same
rank, period. `1Pending`7 members are expected to listen to advice
from others, `1Proven`7 members are expected to help out those newer
to the guild, and `!all`7 members are expected to behave in a mature
manner at all times, both on the guild line and in their interactions
with the players of the mud.

There still might be some things that look a little 'funny' or don't match up quite
right so if you notice something, please drop me a mail so I can fix it.

For those of you that don't know, the area in question is connected to the SW corner
of Outer Road, and is a revamp of the area that was done about 2 years ago.  The
officer's rooms are pretty generic, but eventually they will likely be replaced
with personal guild rooms.

From this point on, the main offices for the Guard will be considered to be in
the barracks area, and not the Palace.  When Avriele was working on fixing up the
Palace area, she had intended to remove the handful of offices there, and they 
still will likely be removed eventually.

So, if you are an officer and would like to have your personal quarters built in
or moved to the Barracks, again let me know and I will get on it. :)

Comments and suggestions always welcome.  Enjoy the area!

rooms situation as per agreements between the Housing Department (me) and the
Tower GLs.

Until I receive notice otherwise from Cormac, all guild room descriptions (for all
guilds) get mailed to me.   So, if you have mailed any to Padraigin, either mail
them to me as well, or let me know that you mailed them and I will get them from
her.

Per the agreement with the Tower GLs:
    All bonded warders are able to have `*1`7 room.
    All Tower Guard of rank Corporal or above are able to have `*1`7 room.
    All PC (not NPC) Sitters or above are able to have `*2`7 rooms.
    All other Aes Sedai are able to have `*1`7 room.

These rooms will be connected to the various Ajah halls and to the appropriate
area of the warder quarters.

I apologize for the confusion.

in rooms that show up on where, as some rooms are so generically
named it's impossible to guess who is in them or where the rooms
are. Perhaps we can add the zone name to the display, or something
of the sort at least, so people can at least get a starting point
to being wandering from.

4	24	1205	1204	1041820356	Tannil	3225	Hmmmm...	Due to the lack of a named builder list for the builders who have
rights in a zone (eg: Standard Circle OLC numbers instead of the
system where you name builders in ZEDIT) it seems that the
builder's names have been placed into the zone titles.  Granted
this could be easily fixed by just having someone go through and
clear the names out, but then that leaves us with the fact that
that the zone names don't follow any real stanard to make it easy
to see where a zone is in the game.

Of course, that doesn't mean that a new field couldn't be added
to the zones which would have a name or description to give people
an idea of where it is.  Such as "on the Almoth Plain" or such.

"A Common room (on the Almoth Plain): 2 people" or what have you.

`7
SQL pfile-saving:
  `1*`7 Once this is completed, we're going to start working on MM3.2
`7
Whatever other misc code changes need to be done in order for the builders
  to get eq brought over.
`7
MikkiMUD 3.2 To-Do (In order of expected completion)
`7
1.)  Switch from prcs to CVS (Source code first, area files after making
     sure builderport and livemud's area files reconcile with each other)
     This could also perhaps make Cormac's job of transfering area files
     from builderport to live mud easier.  commit them from builderport,
     then update livemud with the correct files?  Any thoughts on this?
`7
2.)  Finishing touches to craft code:
     `1-`7 Add commands to add/remove craftable items and the mods.  
        (Craft_Items and Craft_Mods in the database)
`7
3.)  Finishing touches to economy, items that need finishing:
     `1-`7 War menu
     `1-`7 Player war menu
     `1-`7 RP menu
     `1-`7 Provincial Menu (partially completed in 'econshow')
     `1-`7 EQ menu
     `1-`7 When you fail to be able to pay taxes, it should put you
        into a menu that lets you choose which pieces of eq to give
        up in order to pay the taxes.  It should only give them 50%
        credit of the current value of the eq, and should not allow
        then to exit until they've given up enough items to pay off
        the debt.
     (See 'glboard cd show 5' for details)
`7
4.)  Turn based Combat:
     `1-`7 Form system needs coded.  Should be able to have multiple categories 
        of forms, where forms in category X can only be used agiants forms in 
        category Y.  Each form should be able to have certain stats, such as 
        strength and speed.
     `1-`7 Slight revamp needed so that when you attack a player with a form, 
        the player does not automatically respond unless he is in 'automatic' mode.
        If the player is not in automatic mde, he has to respond with the form he 
        wants to block/dodge/counter the attack with.
     `1-`7 Need a toggle for automatic/manual modes.  Possibly with multiple 
        levels of automation.  Fully automatic, or semi-autmatic where it auto-
        matically chooses a response when there is a clear best choice for a 
        responding form, and fully manual.
     `1-`7 Need to be able to attack mobs.
`7
5.)  Retainers:  (I'd like to see these moved to SQL too, if possible)
     `1-`7 Ability to have skills/spells
     `1-`7 Ability to wear eq
     `1-`7 Ability to create buyable 'templates' (Either in code or OLC)
`7
6.)  Channeling system (Still needs details)
`7
7.)  War system: (The details of this are still very much undeveloped)
     `1-`7 This covers the code outside of the code to buy and house troops.  This
        is more for actually handling the battle as it takes place.  I'm
        envisioning a grid based layout somewhat similiar to turn based combat,
        where each square can hold one 'group' of troops (Where a group can be
        some arbitrary number, such as 100 troops, or whatever).  Each player
        involved should be able to control the troops he commands, and they take
        turns making attacks.
`7
Misc (Not in any order):
`7
  Skills:
  `1-`7 Tool
`7
  Building/OLC:

4	24	2067	2067	1052689008	Guy	4051	The Penguin	The Penguin

by Jeramey Crawford <jacrawf@marko.net>
and
Rob Flynn <rob@marko.net>

Once upon a term'nal dreary, while I hack'ed, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten code--
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a beeping,
As of some one gently feeping, feeping using damn talk mode.
"'Tis some hacker," I muttered, "beeping using damn talk mode--
Only this. I hate talk mode."

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak semester,
And college life wrought its terror as the school year became a bore.
Eagerly I wished for privledges;--higher access I sought to borrow
For my term'nal, unceasing sorrow--sorrow for a file called core--
For the rare and radiant files of .c the coders call the core--
Access Denied. Chown me more.

"Open Source," did all mutter, when, with very little flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Penguin of the saintly days of yore.
Quite a bit obese was he; having eaten lots of fish had he,
But, by deign of Finnish programmer, he sat in the middle of my floor--
Looking upon my dusty term'nal in the middle of my floor--
Came, and sat, and nothing more.

Then the tubby bird beguiling my sad code into shining,
By the free and open decorum of the message that it bore,
"Though thy term'nal be dusty and slow," he said, "Linux be not craven!"
And thus I installed a new OS far from the proprietary 
shore--
The kernel code open but documentation lacking on this shore.
Quoth the Penguin, "pipe grep more!"

Much I marvelled this rotund fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help believing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird in the middle of his floor--
Bird or beast sitting in the middle of his cluttered floor,
With such instructions as "pipe grep more."

But the Penguin, sitting lonely in that cluttered floor, spoke only
Those words, as if its soul in that instruction he did outpour.
Nothing more did he need utter; understood did I among that clutter--
Understood his command as I could scarcely do a few moments before--
I typed as furious as was willed me, understanding just a minute before.
Again the bird said "pipe grep more!"

"Amazing!" said I, "Penguin we will conquor the world if you will!
By the Network that interconnects us--by that Finn we both adore--
We'll take this very world by storm!" For now grasped I what he'd meant,
The thing I do while searching /usr/doc/* for that wond'rous lore--
Those compendiums of plaintext documentation and descriptive lore.
Quoth the Penguin, "pipe grep more!"

And the Penguin, never waddling, still is sitting, still is sitting
In the middle of my room and still very cluttered floor;
And his eyes have all the seeming of the free beer I am drinking
And the term'nal-light o'er him glowing throws his shadows on the floor;
And this OS from out the shadows that is pow'ring my term'nal on the floor
Shall be dominating--"Pipe grep more!"

4	13	2675	2675	1063997797	Laurane	2096	Coming attractions	Hey everyone. With the recent guild restructuring and the
timeline change to come, I'm going to be doing a complete
guild overhaul over the coming month or so. Once I figure
out exactly where we are going to be in the books, I will
post a summary of where the Wisdoms and Kin stand in
relation to the rest of the guilds and the rest of
Randland in general.

I will also be restructuring the syllabus (in general, 
making it much more independent and up to y'all as to how 
fast/slow you wish to complete it). Basically, the Wisdoms
(Non-Kin) portion of the guild will be getting a little 
less structured, and the Kin half of the guild will be 
getting a little more structured, or at least a bit more 
organized. All in all, advancement in the guild will be
more based on rp activity than on 'classes'. If you
rp, your char will advance naturally. So don't worry about
taking this or that class, just rp.

Also, you will all notice you have been guilded into the
Laborers Uberguild. Basically, this provides all of us
with an extra channel through which to organize rp. For
the Kinswomen amongst us, it helps now because you no
longer have to be a Wisdom (not that you ever 'had' to
be), and for non-channeling wisdoms, it will allow you
contact to those in your communities and do all that
information gathering (gossip) that wisdom's do oh so
well.

As far as my position, it remains relatively unchanged. 
From my understanding, I will still be the GL in charge 
of the Wisdoms portion of the guild, while Beonca will 
be taking care of any ooc matters relating to our 
association with the laborers uberguild. So any 
Wisdom's/Kin stuff, you can direct to me. Any stuff that 
might relate to laborers in general, or things beyond
the typical scope of our guild, you can direct to Beonca.
(Though if it has some connection to our guild, I would
appreciate being included in the issues, just so I am
aware of what's going on and can have a better idea of
how to make the guild better for y'all.)

Again, I will be following this up with further postings
to clarify exactly what is changing and how. At the
moment, I'm just waiting to see exactly where the timeline
is moving to, and I want to talk to a few of the other
guilds to make sure we're all on the same page.

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.

Your friendly neighborhood GL,

Laurane

PS. I will probably also be 'cleaning hosue' soon, so to
speak. We have some in the guild who have not logged on
in almost a year. If you wish to keep your char guilded,
please send me a short note saying so. This mainly
applies to those of you I haven't seen in a while. Also,
if you wouldn't mind, let me know what your char is up
to. I will probably be doing this AFTER the timeline shift,
so don't worry if you don't know where your char is
going to fit in. I will post again later letting you know
exactly when I'm going to be doing all this. I just wanted
to give y'all a heads up.

4	13	2876	2876	1066966152	Laurane	2096	`!Advancement in the Guild`7	Ok, here's the deal on advancement in the guild. For the
Wisdoms part, you're pretty much on your own as far as
how fast/slow you want your character to develop. I'll try
to keep an eye on things to make sure that no one is rp'ing
unrealistically (ie giving someone an herbal potion that 
somehow instantly heals a broken leg), but beyond that, how
you rp is up to you. You can start as an apprentice and
make up a mentor for yourself. You can find another Wisdom
in the guild to teach you (I try to do it myself when I can,
but I'm in school an awful lot so my rp comes in spurts).
Basically, I just want to make sure that you can advance
and aren't just waiting on me so you can get some required
lesson. I trust all of you enough to rp your characters
intelligently. The only thing I ask is that you keep me
updated on your character's progress. That way, not only
do I know where everyone in the guild stands, but I can
update your rank if necessary.

For the Kin part, I have to be a little more strict. Because
in the books, the Kin really didn't train channelers, we
have to be careful how much a Kinswoman is taught, and
how far her ability and skill progress. Now granted, we
take a bit more liberty here in training women to channel,
but realize that training here proceeds much more slowly
than in the Tower, and is not nearly as complete. That
said, I am going to set a certain 'syllabus' if you will,
but it's really only a guide as to how far along in channeling
your ability has progressed. Based on your background, you 
will start and different levels along the ladder. Each
lesson must be taught by someone who is at least two
lessons ahead of you for you to advance to the next skill
level in your channeling. Also note that these are
guidelines for your skill, not your strength. Remember that 
you can techically know how to Heal even if you're not
strong enough in the One Power to actually do it.


The lessons/skill levels are as follows.

1. Introduction to the One Power/Basics of channeling
This is a non-channeling lesson. Basically, it covers all
the basic information about channeling. what Saidin/Saidar
are, the dangers of channeling, some examples of what can
be done, what channeling is, what weaving is, etc. You
cannot grasp or channel at this level.

2. Grasping/Releasing
Fairly self explanatory. At this level, you can grasp and
release, but cannot yet channel the One Power.

3. Single flow channeling/simple weaves
The basics of channeling simple flows of the five powers.
At this level, you can do very basic weaves which involve
only one of the five powers. (ie a ball of spirit, a breeze
of air, lighting a candle, etc.)

4. Advanced weaving with a single flow
At this level, you are getting fairly proficient with your
channeling, but can still only handle one flow at a time.
Basically like the one above, but with bigger flows that
can have a bit more of an effect. (ie. A club of air, 
a ball of fire, shielding, etc.) At this level, linking
is also taught.

5. Multi flow channeling/simple weaves

At this stage, you've learned enough control that you can
add a second, third, or even more flows to your weave.
However, because of the added strain of multiple flows,
you are again limited to simple weaves if you try to use
multiple flows. At this level, you also learn the process
of guiding someone through breaking a block.

6. Advanced weaving with multiple flows
You're quite skilled in channeling at this point. You have
good control over your flows, and are able to combine them
in increasingly difficult weaves. (gentle/sever) At the
top of this level is Healing.

Please remember this while you're training. Learning about
the Kin as a group is a function of how long you've been
under the tutelage of a Kinswoman, not necessary how well
trained you are. You can be in training, and still not
know about the Kin. Remember, it's a big risk telling our
secret. So just because you're being trained to channel, don't
assume you know about the Kin. Knowledge of the Kin will
only come through RP. If you haven't found out IC'ly from
another player, don't assume you know it.

Also note that you DO NOT have to complete all six lessons
to be considered a full Kinswoman. There are Kinswomen who
represent skill levels ranging the full range. Once you
are IC'ly told about the Kin, you are brought in and are
considered to be a full Kinswoman. Because remember, status
in the Kin is based on age, not skill or strength in the power.
You could potentially be like Morgase, never advance beyond
lesson 3, yet still rank higher in the Kin than someone at
level 6 so long as you were older. Just something to keep
in mind.

4	22	3084	3084	1071529653	Faerid	4217	`#!T`1ournament?`0	Hello folks, I got to thinking last evening and was pondering the idea
of a major, longer term tournament and was wondering about thoughts,
suggestions, or comments ya'll might have. I'll give a rough outline
of what I was considering now (one idea considers the possibility of
a completed/semi-completed combat code which may be optimistic, and
alternatives will be planned ;))

So, anyways, what I was thinking of was an IC tournament in the Caemlyn
area involving 4 events and spanning a period of a month RL, each with an
IC prize and making use of character WM (now that people have had a chance
to make use of the new system if they want and so forth, and to encourage
others). The month long tournament would be announced an additional month
in advance to give people a chance to OOCly enter/prepare, and to generate
RP, such as allowing people time to ICly travel to Caemlyn if they wish,
the nobles to sponsor champions, the crafters/artisans to prepare wares
or events, and so on. I want this to be a major IC event, not just the
quickie week long tournament that used to be as much OOC as IC. I also
want people to be able to NPC contestants if they can't make it themselves
ICly, of equal or lesser comparable WM skill. An NPC contestant who wins
the tournament would also ICly win the prize, not the PC playing them
(perhaps something could be arranged a bit). At the end of the tournament
I'd like to see a ball/festival/party/whatever potentially generated by
the players and another department in which the prizes will be awarded and
such. All that said, I'll give a brief run over on my ideas for the 4
combat events.

1) Wrestling - I don't think this has been done in a tournament before,
and it would be a good event to permit rich or common alike to participate
as they wish. It would be a combination of grecko-roman and sumo wrestling
for the environment. Match held in a ring 15 feet in diameter, and winning
conditional on 2 falls or disabling the opponent (knocking them out or
breaking an limb, or submission). A fall will be constituted by either driving
an opponent outside the bounds of the ring or pinning their back to the ground
(shoulders and lower back in contact) for a period of 3-5 seconds or more.
This will use WM much like a normal spar for the players own estimates of
their ability and a draw (say a double knockout) will have victory awarded
to the player with the highest WM. This event would take place over the first
week of the tournament.

2) Joust - you should all have some idea what this is. Entry would require
the entrant to have their own mount and means of protection. Lances will be
provided and blunted. The event will consist of 3 passes, the player with
the most points at the end of these three passes being declared the winner.
1 point will be awarded for breaking the lance on the body/shield of the
enemy, 2 points for breaking the lance on their head, and 3 points for
dismounting them. Each pass will be a combination of a dice roll and
an emote series (the charge, impact, aftereffects, etc). The dice roll
will be made with a toss of 5d6. A roll of 6 or less by a player will
mean their horse was injured and they not only lose that round but will
be unable to continue. A roll of less then 10 will be a miss, meaning the
lance either did not connect at all or did not break. A roll of 10 to 19
will be a break on the body for 1 point. A roll of 20 to 24 will be a break
on the head, and a roll of 25-30 will be a dismounting of an opponent.
Should the players have a tie on points at the end of 3 passes they will
face off in a spar to determine the victor, and the victor of a round will
keep the opponents mount. WM will come into play either during the spar or
more relevantly during the dice rolls. A player with WM1/100 or less will
roll 5d6 once for their result. A player with WM2/100 or less will roll
twice, WM3/100 3 times, and a player with some WM4 will get 4 rolls. The
best roll will be used for the determination of points at the end of each
pass (so someone with WM3 rolls 9, 18, 22 for a pass. They will use the
22 result to break their lance on their opponents helm for 2 points and
emote thus after the pass has been rolled/determined). This event will
take place over the second week of the tournament.

3) Traditional 1vs1 sparring - as it sounds, basic one on one sparring
as everyone is familiar with using emote fights. I'm considering a double
elimitation tournament (you must lose twice to lose), with WM used as
we're all familiar, or the player with the highest WM winning in event
of a draw. The initial spars will take place over the first 2 weeks of
the tournament, during the Wrestling matches and Jousting, until there
are only 4 participants reamining with less then 2 losses. These 4 will
spar over the 3rd week to determine a victor.

4) Melee - I was kind of hoping to have combat code to do this, such as
getting every
4	24	3329	3329	1075449446	Fredrik	30	Weapon reach?	Ping.
I noticed that "weapon reach" is introduced.
How is that supposed to work, now that the grid
and thus all references to "distance" will be gone?

/F

4	24	3331	3329	1075485820	Duren	9	Weapon reach	Uhh, yeah, you coded it. :p  We can just do away with it, I'd say, cause it's
pointless w/out the grid...

-Duren

4	24	3337	3337	1075544793	Fredrik	30	Beta 1	Hi.
I just committed the first trial version of turn based combat
with "autocombat" feature and without grids. I tried a couple variants,
such as killing a mob and dying by a mob, and none crashed it. :P
There are probably a lot of other variants that _will_ crash it,
so now we need to get this fighting tested. I leave that bit to
the public relations people.
Note that features such as "force auto" isn't in, yet.
One thing at a time. =)

/Fredrik

0	0	3417	3417	1076523691	Nicodemus	1805	`@C`2ode `@C`2ombat`7	Hey, all.  Given all the neat things we learned from MM3 about how not to implement
large projects, I'm generally conservative in how much we discuss projects once
they'v moved past the conceptual phase and are actually being coded.  However,
it's been brought to our attention that some misconceptions are circulating
regarding combat, so I'm going to post some general information to clear things
up.

`6What's combat going to be like?`7

   Firstly, combat is going to be a form and skill based system again, with
   emphasis on balancing IC realism and customizable gameplay.  The grid
   is gone, since it was unpopular and caused enormous problems with retainers
   and mobs and multiple groups fighting each other.  It has three major
   settings with varying degrees of speed and user interaction.  All settings
   allow for users to adjust how their character fights at any time prior to,
   or during combat.  They range from manual (similar to turn based combat,
   for those few players who want something to supplement their emotes in an
   emote fight) to automatic, which is quick and doesn't hang on waiting
   for players to input commands.  For policy purposes, priority goes to the
   fastest setting (manual, semi-auto or automatic) of any combatant, so
   that when someone starts supermanning to the point of being ridiculous,
   a more senior combatant can once again say 'eff this' and pkill the
   bugger in short order.  Provided that legal RP leads up to a pkill, we'll
   be enforcing it as an IC death, as we did in MM2.

`6Does this mean we're getting away from determining levels from RPing?`7

   No.  You do not have to run around killing mobs as a prerequisite to
   having a decent pfile.  Levels will still be determined through RP, and
   code power will still be determined largely by RP and RP ability.  We're
   just adding more ways to represent a character's abilities, and some of
   them (such as combat skills) can be increased by use.  The emphasis is
   still on RP, but you will definitely benefit from taking part in code
   combat with mobs and other players.  And obviously, the more code combat
   you're involved in, the better your character gets at it.

`6What's changing?`7

   We're bringing back options that allow you to control your style and how
   much you're exerting yourself.  The code also tracks the number and types
   of wounds to bodyparts, such that the wounds you take hamper your ability
   to fight.  A character's combat status includes a number of new, more IC
   fields, although this info is presented to players in a more general
   fashion than the complicated number-tracking that the code handles.  You
   can eventually pass out and/or die from losing blood over one good stab
   wound even if your HPs are still high, pass out from fatigue, and walk
   away with wounds that heal over time (or kill you later) and that can be
   healed with channeling or first-aid skills.  If your right arm is numb or
   broken, it makes it kinda hard to hit people, and if your sword hand is
   miserably gashed up, you won't be able to wield your weapon effectively.
   The entire system is based on mods, though, so it's rarely as simple as
   saying 'your leg is broken, so now you are barred from doing this and
   this'.  There's a chance you can pull almost anything off at any time,
   even if you hurt yourself trying.  It's a system of critical hits and
   a lot of mods and as much realism as we can cram into it while still
   enhancing gameplay, instead of making the system unwieldy and confusing.

   We'll also be recalculating things like stats and HPs, since currently
   they're not really relative to anytihng concrete, and, IMO, are kinda
   stupid.  25 strength means what, exactly? Nobody's code stats represent
   their IC characters anymore, so we're endeavoring to fix that.  Combat
   will be much more realistic than just keeping track of the number of
   time you can get stabbed before you die, and deals with a lot more than
   simple HP totals (which are now mainly just invisible benchmarks for
   other calculations).

`6Bah, I liked Turn Based Combat.  Lets just finish that, shall we?`7

   Once we get the skeleton system (meaning a fully running combat system
   but without all of the details we've laid the foundation for), code
   combat will be brought in.  We will continue adding to it extensively
   as we go.  If you've got any questions/comments, feel free to ask.
   We're gonna get real grouchy real fast if anybody says 'this sucks,
   lets keep TBC' tho.

Also, Fredrik rocks.

Lastly, no proofreading took place at any time on this.  It's not that
Nico doesn't know how to type, it's that he just doesn't care. *sage*

4	24	3426	3426	1076878557	Duren	9	Shared Source?  Tell me what you think.	Shared Source proposal:

Ok Guys, tell me what you think about this:  I'm think we should consider 
'opening up' some of Tyme's code.  Why?  To expand our pool of brain power.  I 
realize most players probably won't be able to take advtantage of it, but I 
notice we have alot of people who are intelligent CS majors, but aren't really 
good enough or trustworthy enough to be given full access to the code.  By 
opening up areas of the code, such as afflcitions, we can harness the brain 
power of people who we wouldn't normally be able.  How?  Set up a mailing list 
of some sort, and allow people to submit patches.  One of Tymes official coders 
will give it a good look over, and if it seems like a good thing to have, and if
the Head Coder agrees, it could get patched in.  Even if we turn away most 
patches, this could give us alot of ideas.  Just because a patch in and of 
itself is bad, doesn't necessarily mean the idea behind it is bad, it just needs
better coding.  Areas of code I think would be good canidates for this:

Afflictions code:  Let players send in patches for new afflcitions.
Skills/Spells:  Let players send in patches for new skills.
Arbitrary commands:  Things like the score sheet, look, scan, etc.  Stupid 
                     little small details that most coders don't worry themselves 
                     with.
Possibly others?

Be advised, I am fully aware of all the downsides to something like this.  It 
still means work for coders, because we'd have to review each patch submitted in
detail.  It may also be a pain to set up, since all shared code would have to be
moved into seperate files from un-shared code.  For legal reasons, we'd need 
some sort of license.  Also, to allow players to compile/test their code, we'd 
have to build and release some form of library that contains the un-shared 
functions.  So the player could compile his .c files into .o files, then link 
that against the 'big library' to get a functioning MUD server.  We'd also need 
to place some hard coded limits on that as well, to prevent people from running 
rogue copies of MM3, IE, hard code it so that only 3 players can connect at a 
time, hard code like 4 rooms, and hard code a simple pfile.
I realize it'd be awkward to setup, has some risks assosiated and may be a 
general pain.  But I think we could increase new code changes enough to make it 
worthwhile.  Thoughts?

-Duren

4	24	3438	3426	1076945679	Duren	9	Fredrik	Yeah, I'd say documentation would be the biggest hurdle here.  But,
documentation would be a good thing for us to have, anyhow.

As far as running a seperate port of Tyme being a policy/technical
matter, i feel it's both.  If you release a version of Tyme with
no coded limitations, people will abuse it.  I've got a couple
ideas on how to prevent people from abusing it.  First of all,
limit the max number of connections to 3.  Then, remove the
ability to load pfiles from the database, so all players
who log on get the 'hard coded' pfile, which would probably
be trust 99 so that the player can have access to everything
on his little MUD.  As far as mimicking?  Nah, that's not
really what i meant.  I was talking more along the lines of
removing it's need.  Make hard coded structs for 4 rooms, 1
pfile, and whatever else the MUD needs to boot.  If there
are things that really -do- need to come from the database,
we could easily setup another user on Tyme's database with
SELECT only access to certain tables, so that the user
wouldn't have to download, install, and setup MySQL.

The latter could also be used as a simple way of knowing
who's running Tyme.  We can monitor connections to the database,
as well as give each user their own database username.

As far as distribution:  My thought was to make a script, (possibly
called from codeswitch) that would automatically build the new toolkit
and copy the appropriate files to public_html where users can download
them.  We could even set up the script to auto-email everyone letting
them know a new version has been released.

involved with Events as an IMM.  They were good ideas that for one reason or 
another never got put into motion.  Also, I want to be clear that I don't get 
credit for these, it goes to the people who first send them to me.  This one 
was an idea from Timmy, at that time the head WM Imm.
"The Lost Library"
 
   I'd like to resurrect an old event-idea I was spawning on back
during my days as an event immortal: it was a large-scale Role-play
scenario that would involve many major guilds in a form of "treasure
hunt" in lack of a better word.
   The event would revolve around a mythical library, rumored to 
contain volumes of knowledge from the Age of Legends believed to be
lost. A most alluring keep for many: let me briefly elaborate the 
main guilds that should have some interest in this.
 
-White Tower-
   Naturally: they always stick their nose into things :P And with
something like this that could contain vital information for them 
to use in the struggle against the Shadow, it should most certainly
provide with some temptation.
 
-Daes Dae'mar-
   They want power, most of them: some would be curious about this
treasure, others could see it as a chance of gaining larger influence
and strengthen their position. 
 
-Whitecloak-
   Spanish Inquisition? They don't want witchcraft knowledge like 
this to slip out into the open, and they'd definitely wouldn't want
the Aes Sedai to get their hands on it either, most certainly.
 
-Darkfriends-
   Old knowledge would be a valuable weapon against their enemies:
enough said.
 
-Merchants-
   Maybe a small bystander primarily, but given their connections 
and their trade, they may get themselves involved for their own 
reasons. 
 
   Of course, there is nothing to say that any guild or individual 
couldn't participate, but these would be the more "major" factions
involved, that would gain the most by pursuing this mythical keep.
 
-How to get them all involved-
   Still sketchy: I was considering a "secret society" that are 
responsible for keeping the library safe: either they accidentally
leaked information to various parts, or they deliberately did so.
   Clues in form of notes, small RP-sessions and similar endeavors
would be used to make most of these factions aware of the keep's 
existence.
 
-How do we keep it running?-
   In my experience, large RP-processes are hard to organize: hence
we would need to make it self-sufficient as much as possible. The
event itself would be a treasure hunt, basically: by providing clues
to places where more clues are to be found, we monitor the progress
of each by a sound usage of the mail system. 
   I.e. participant X from guild Y has reasoned out that the next 
clue is located in Illian. He mails us with this information, stating
how he came to that conclusion and what he intends to do about it:
either we arrange a small RP-session, or me wail the results to him
on what he may have found.
   Although the latter may not sound that exciting, there would still
be enough RP-sessions to be satisfactory for the majority of the 
participants, methinks: the less scheduled events, the better: lets 
try and be impulsive?
 
-Treasures?-
   I'm fully aware of that knowledge from the AoL may be a too 
powerful item to release onto the Mud :P I'm not proposing that 
the end result would necessarily be just this: maybe a few fragments
that we could be lenient in supplying? Maybe some other treasures,
like Angreal's or something similar? Maybe the Library has a form 
of self-destruction weave woven around it so that no one get nil?
You decide.
   Anyway, this is just a brief summary of the idea: I've got more 
details in case you are interested. What say you? I'd help running
this, just so you know.

A bell tolls, a crow squawks, and a cow gives birth to a calf with nine heads.

I'm going with at least three that we directly mocked. There must have been more.

Question:

Is the White Tower currently aware of any way to 
completely dissolve/undo the bond between an Aes 
Sedai and her Warder so that the link no longer 
exists and all the positive and negative effects 
of the bond are removed?

Robert Jordan Answers:

Yes, they are. It is called releasing a Warder, 
and an Aes Sedai who is very old or injured so 
badly that she knows she is going to die will, 
if she has the strength, release him so he doesn't 
suffer from her death. This does require the two 
of them to be together, and a little more time that 
laying on the bond. If they are physically apart, 
or she doesn't have enough time or strength 
remaining, touch on him.

It has also been used to get rid of a Warder who 
proved to be unsuitable in some way, such as a man 
who is discovered to be a thief or who takes 
reckless chances, a fighter of duels who won't 
stop without the bond being used to force him. 
No sister is going to want a Warder who will risk 
getting himself killed, with all the attendant 
results to her, for no very good reason.

Although use of the bond in that way (controlling) 
was not unknown in the past, it came to be regarded 
as a form of Compulsion to use it so except in the 
slightest forms. Besides, using the bond to control 
a Warder all the time is a lot of work. An Aes Sedai 
wants somebody who can watch her back and keep it safe, 
not somebody she has to work on all the time. (Which 
is one of the reasons Aes Sedai stopped bonding men 
against their will. Not ethical concerns or ethical 
growth, I'm afraid; it was just not very practical 
really) Better simply to release the fellow who can't 
measure up and find another who will.

By the by, releasing a Warder except for cause (the 
Aes Sedai's imminent death, his own unsuitability) or 
because he has asked for release is something that JUST 
IS NOT DONE! It would gain the sister considerable 
opprobrium from other sisters. A sister certainly 
would be looked at askance if she released a Warder 
who was dying, for example, just to avoid the effects 
on her of his death. When an Aes Sedai bonds a Warder, 
she is expected to buy in for the full ride. For that 
matter, releasing him for unsuitability is considered 
to reflect on the sister's judgement. She should have 
known better about him from the start.

Rogosh Eagleeye, one of the most infamous Hunters,
Traveled far, wide, up and down. His sword his friend,
His sword his enemy. As he searched, he came upon
A rumor, of the Horn's whereabouts, the elusive

Reclusive item of legend. His travels took him to
Tar Valon, where the Wheel spins eternal,
Caemlyn, where the Red Lion roars loudest,
Cairhien, where the nobles scheme,
But in it all, he and his fellow Hunters stood steadfast,
Until the reached, -breached-, the Blight. The tainted
Woods, the damned Deserts, and the rocks of Shayol Ghul.
He believed the Horn was buried there, along a pass,
Hidden where Trolloc and Halfman alike would not seek,
To be found for the Last Battle, to be used for life,
The honest men sought it, but found it naught,
To be met by a Halfman and his squadron.
Rogosh's mind spun, how was he deceived?
Who told upon his arrival? But no matter,
Rogosh said, releasing his blade, his wrath,
Upon the Half-Dead. Blade from Borderland smithies
Met steel wrought in Thakan'Dor, made with the lives
Of innocent men. Blades danced, and Herons Wading in Water
Met the Shadow Lurks Deep, and as if it were with
The very Light's strength, Rogosh fought, but even
Though that Halfman had the luck of the Dark,
Rogosh's blade soon found true. As blade met tainted
Flesh, blood flew through, and the Dark writhed with pain,
For a battle had been won in the Light's name.
Rogosh sheathed, his men joyous, and even though the Half-Dead
Shrieked with the pain of the Light, the screams
Came not to the Light's good ears. As the Trollocs
Screamed, grabbing their heads, they were soon dead.
Arrows came, loosed from the bows of the Light,
From the bows of Rogosh, of the men who followed,
And as the battle was victorious at last, the war was not.
For the Shadow still lived, and the Horn was lost. For now,
At least, the men still sought the Horn to their last breath.
So Rogosh went back, and his horse's hooves
Tore the earth as the trot back, having once more
Been freed from the Mother's Last Embrace,
Were still fighting in the War of the Light.

a bunch of bad links, and if I find any, typos.  Then I'll go on the hunt
for a big project.  Maybe I should check on Beonca and the Event Guild soon.

***Just me.

   it's got no combat stats then it doesn't need to be taxed anyway.
   I think we'll open up combat qeq of this type up down the road,
   but it will probably have to be taxed.  If I can figure out a way
   to make some system of one or two exception slots or something
   that won't screw econ up, we can do that, too.  For the moment
   though, I'd think of this more like code toys - fun stuff that's
   cool and personalized.  All the imms want lightsabers (big
   surprise).  I dunno what kind of ideas you guys have - for me,
   I'd probably want a one-of-a-kind Seafolk lantern that self-
   tools and something else for my hold slot.

   I dunno - if this doesn't make sense to you guys, I'll explain
   real quick how the lightsabers work.  There's an object in
   the imm zone called a lightsaber - its description is "===.="
   when you load one.  When you activate it, everybody in the room
   hears it, you get a message and the object retools itself
   into ===.=------------------, except in color and the blade
   has the background color around each dash as well as the bright
   color.  I'm on raw telnet so I'm not gonna try it here :p But
   maybe that'll give you guys some ideas.

4	20	3933	3933	1089147089	Duren	9	Creating ships:	Ships are now working, here's how you create them:

                            HOW TO CREATE A NEW SHIP
`7
 01. Write the rooms for the ship itself and be sure to include the following rooms:
      a)The room with the boarding plank...must be flagged with PLANK flag.
      b)The room that the ship will be steered from...must be flagged HELM flag
`7
 02. All rooms in the ship must have the SHIP flag
`7
 03. Any rooms from which you should be able to see the room the ship is in should be flaged DECK
`7
 04. The vnums of the ship rooms should be continous..You can not use split groups of rooms like
     200 to 215 + 230 to 240...you should use a range like 41800 to 41885 with none of the rooms in
     that range exiting anywhere in the world outside of the ship.
`7
 05. Create an object of type 33 (ship)
`7
 06. Value 0 on the object should be set to the room number the player will go to when they enter the
     ship.
`7
 07. Value 2 on the object should be set to the starting vnum of the rooms inside the ship object.
`7
 08. Value 3 on the object should be set to the ending vnum of the rooms inside the ship object
`7
 09. All other values should be left at zero.The code will manipulate them as needed.
`7
 10. The object should be set in the zone file for the area to load in a room that is not WATER_SWIM
       or WATER_NOSWIM....it should however be one room away from a room with either of those sector
       types.
`7
 11. There can only be one of each ship object on the mud.If you want additional ships, build them,
     with their own unique object # and rooms inside.

4	22	3967	3967	1091576835	Nicodemus	1805	`#M`3eandering `#T`3rails`7	War is probably nearing the completion of his conceptual phase,
and after a last major issue is agreed on, it'll be ready for
coding.  At the moment, it is likely that we will need a builder
to help with some relatively simple, but large scale, work, as
we'll need to connect some dots across the world between cities.

4	22	3979	3967	1092198638	Jake	5770	Update: Aug 10	   The building team consists of:
   Varulv and Eliana (War)
   Boris (Code support)
   Ranulf (Expert Consultant)
   Beonca (Cuz Nico bugged her til she caved)
   Nicodemus (Shell Access/Zone Creation)

I just finished creating the template zone - it's 10 rooms
by 10 rooms, as we discussed, and has a generic desc and a
raided desc for every room.  All exits are properly connected
(can you imagine how much it would suck it we pasted a screwed
up zone 100 times?).  The zone is 411, and the vnums are
41100 - 41199.  I created it as zone 411 because it's the
single largest 'empty' block of zone numbers - we can create
consecutively numbered zones up til about zone 500.  I'm
going to make copies of this zone, and then we'll assign zones
to each of us to connect the edges to the adjacent zones.  I'm
going to have to think on what the fastest way is to renumber
the exits in each zone - anybody know if VI has a replace
command? We'd have to replace every instance of 411xx with
412xx, then 413xx, etc.  That's going to take days to do by
hand.

Anyway, we're going to create and connect this grid off
by itself, first, and then we'll splice the RP hubs that
we're keeping into it.  Basically, we'll find where we
want Caemlyn to be, remove one single room from that zone,
and have the exits that did lead into that room lead into
each of the four major gates of Caemlyn.  We may make Caemlyn
take up a block of four rooms, too, depending on the scale
we decide on.

-Nico

4	22	3984	3967	1092613713	Nicodemus	1805	.	   I've got the first 33 zones uploaded now (that's all of rows
   A, B and D on the grid map).  If any of you have time, I'd
   really appreciate help connecting the exits - the zones themselves
   are done, but the edges need to be connected to the adjacent zone.
   Thanks!

4	22	3987	3985	1093171794	Faerid	4217	Re: State of the MUD	Well, being one of those Imms who has been caught into RL, and still
is unfortunately, I don't really have a right to say much on current
things. I can say though that, if Tyme does shut down, I may not be
back if/when it comes back up and I imagine many other older players
would be the same. I've been here a long time now...damn near 7 years
in fact, and have had a lot fo fun and met many people. I've also been
through quite a bit of crap, and seen many of those friends leave while
I stayed behind out of a sense of responsibility as much as a sense
of enjoyment. I did most of what I wanted to do with an Imm position
with the revamp of the WM system and am happy with how it functions now,
if uncertain who I'd trust to take over WM and WK, if I did leave, and
run em in a way which reflects my original intent with the two.
Either way though Tyme shutting down for a month, two months, three
is probably going to be enough to break off even that connection. I
don't want to leave, I don't look forwards to it, and I don't think
Tyme should shut down for the simple reason that, like me, at least
now many of the older players keep tabs at least or check in to see
if things have changed to their satisfaction, and shutting down until
it's complete is just going to sever those ties completely so they
won't even know to come back afterwards even if they choose to.
Basically, if Tyme shuts down now, it'd have to restart from the
ground up most likely and find a whole new player base since it
would have forfeited the older player base. If it stays open then
the older player base still stays connected, and a new player base
may be found -additionally- once MM3.2 is done.

Anyways, I've just woken up and am rambling a bit. Hope some
coherency can be wrangled out of all that.

0	0	4086	4086	1100382117	Nicodemus	1805	`^N`6ew `^W`6orld `^M`6ap`7	   Boris, Duren and I have finished upgrading Randland to a new
   'continental' version on the builderport.  Instead of having cities
   connected by tedious, looping trails that are sometimes hundreds
   of rooms long, the cities we know and love are being placed where
   they belong on a fully traversable, fully built continent.  Now that
   the coding is done, what we need is a few more volunteers (we already
   have a group) to help write better descs for the areas of the
   continent that surround RP hotspots, like Caemlyn and Tar Valon.
   This is not exactly building, since all the hard stuff in classic
   building has been finished.  The last step is to write better descs
   for these rooms - things like the roads that connect cities, and
   the countryside around cities.  If you're willing to join in and help
   us flesh out Randland, please see Syrah or myself and we'll set you
   up.  Thanks!

4	20	4230	4230	1104957854	Nicodemus	1805	`#N`3ew `#P`3roject `#G`3roup`7	   Hey guys, this is for the new builders working on the ubermap - thanks
   for your help.  In one day of heavy work (thanks especially to Phaedra)
   the vast majority of the hard stuff for Caemlyn, Aringill, and zones 640,
   639 and 638 are done.  What is left is some of the descs, so if you guys
   could write better descs than the default ones that'd be great.  There are
   several accompanying files to help too - it's a package containing a
   'to-do' list .doc file, and two bitmaps.  The to-do list explains exactly
   what we're doing, and the pictures are maps and show what each room
   needs to be.  If you don't have a copy of it, please get Syrah, Nenae,
   myself or any of the other builders to forward it to you, and please be
   sure to read the top of the to-do list file.  It explains how we're descripting.

   For my part, I'm looking at bringing over the next major city onto the
   BP - it's either gonna be Tar Valon or Cairhien but they're both a mess
   and I hate them both :p If you guys have any questions at all, don't
   hesitate to ask me or one another.

   Oh, also, if you guys are very productive I can give you the first piece
   of new qeq - they're glowstones and they've got more code in them than
   a xoran or beonca doll :p They're cool.

   Thanks!

   please make comments here.

4	20	4238	4237	1105172389	Nicodemus	1805	.	   Fast-navigation system is done for these zones.  To teleport
   to a city, type:
   goto <city name>

   This places you in a sort of limbo room above the city.  Go
   in any cardinal direction to arrive at the respective gate of
   the city.

   I've also added some wagon rut objects, in green, to mark the
   rooms outside city gates.  I'm not entirely sure if I like 'em
   there (and I'm debating bringing back wagons anyway), but I
   think we need some sort of similar way to mark city gates and
   also roads in general.  Any ideas?

   Also, would you guys do me a favor and walk from Caemlyn to
   Aringill? I love the descs everybody is doing over the whole
   countryside, but I think we need a quick way to tell which
   way roads go without having to read the desc.  Maybe if we
   highlight the directions in a bright color? What do you think?

   -Nic

4	20	4240	4237	1105178648	Phaedra	6892	Zone 639	Just following orders.  :)  I have completed all of Zone 639, as well as completing the Aringill city vnums on the to-do list.  I will continue to work on zone 638, and last I heard, Nenae was hard at work on 640.

If you're walking around and notice anything that you think needs changing, let me know, I'd be happy to do it so you don't have to.  :)  Additionally, just fyi if you're working on Zone 638 (and if you know this already, sorry) - the River which forks of northeast is the River Alguenya, while the name to the northwest is the Erinin, and it becomes the Erinin as they merge just north of Aringill.

Great work everyone!

   original ubermap, I apparently made a mistake.  All rooms
   with a room number ending in 47 (1 per zone) have a
   mislinked exit - if you go west, you end up in room 44,
   instead of room 46.  I'm going to have to fix these manually
   as we bring the zones in - just thought you guys should know.
   I fixed the ones in the zones we're working on.

   us (can't wait for that).  I've connected the zones where it's
   going to be inserted into and added the 'goto tar valon' marker
   so you can jump right to where the city is going.  It'll be
   inserted in the same fashion as Aringill and Caemlyn, and I'm
   also going to port over Alindaer to border it, as well.

   I've started descripting random rooms around the zones - I get
   bored quickly doing consecutive rooms.  If you're bored with what
   you're doing, please see me and we can switch you to a new project.

   Thanks :>

4	20	4254	4248	1105475873	Nicodemus	1805	Update	   Maelyn is making last adjustments to the Tar Valon
   island now.  I've finalized how it's going to be
   inserted into the countryside map and have started
   setting that up.

   The plan is as follows: We're going to construct the
   new city without actually giving it descs - basically,
   we build it as fast as humanly possible, and then I
   insert it into the countryside so it's all hooked up.
   Then, Mae and whoever else she'd like to help can go
   on and describe the rooms.

   Of secondary note is the re-insertion of Alindaer.
   Some of you might be aware that Alindaer and TV are
   built wrong on this port - they're oriented completely
   incorrectly for both zones, and additionally, Alindaer
   is supposed to be south of the island and not west.
   After looking Alindaer over, what I've decided to do is
   to just edit the bridge of Alindaer itself - make it
   exit in the correct direction instead of doing any
   heavier modifications of the zone.  After I do that,
   I'm going to insert it into the ubermap where it
   belongs.

   Anybody who's up for it can start writing new countryside
   descs for the Tar Valon countryside or any other relevant
   zone.  Also, if you have anything you'd particularly like
   to be in charge of (say, you want to design a zone), that'll
   be just fine - just let me know which.

   Thanks!

   existing zones and picked out what we're going to keep (one zone
   is so badly corrupted on all ports that it's useless), and we're
   gonna do the same deal where we port the zones over, and insert
   them where they belong.  If anybody's interested in helping,
   contact Syrah.

4	20	4307	4307	1106935588	Nicodemus	1805	`7Update`7	   I've done much of the renovations on Alindaer so that we can hook it
   up where it belongs, next to Maelyn's new Tar Valon.  Much of the city
   really sucks description-wise, and I've been trying to modify it.  Firstly,
    it was built wrong (Mikki read the map sideways), so she's got a large
   number of the eastern rooms as being on the Erinin river, so I had
   to remove them.  I also fixed a bunch of mislinked rooms, but I'm sure
   there are more.  I don't consider Alindaer to be too important, so
   mostly we're just going to connect the correct new gates to the
   rooms on the ubermap, so that you can enter the town.  I also adjusted
   the bridge some so that it leads in the correct direction, and as soon
   as we're ready, I'm going to connect it to Maelyn's via the new
   bridges.  If you guys can spare the time in a few days, it's going to take
   several of us to do this project efficiently.

   FYI, besides, this, the only other city I'm too concerned about is Cairhien,
   which Syrah is working on.  When both of these are in, we're going to
   start looking at porting in the ubermap.  There will be a few more zones
   to add, of course, but for the most part these cities are the big projects
   and we're just going to stick the other zones in quickly.

4	20	4310	4310	1107064016	Duren	9	OLC changes	OLC now automatically creates two way links.  (Don't even get me started on
what I had to do to implement this.  *curses repeatadly*)

You can disable this behavior if you want.  When you enter the 'Exit Menu',
set 'Two-way link' to 'No'.

I had to hack this feature in, so there are some nuances:

1.)  When you create a 2 way link, the room you are editing is automatically saved -internally-.
2.)  If you create a link, to say, room 100.  It will create a link from room 100 back.
     If you change the link to room 200.  The link from 100 back to the room you're editting will
     still be there.  I'll fix this in the near future, it'll require more code hacks. :p

This OLC was definitly not designed to handle such complicated tasks as two-way links
*eyeroll*, so if you encounter problems... Well, don't make me remind you about the
'bug' command. :p

4	22	4322	4322	1107300694	Nicodemus	1805	`^T`6hings`7	   Hey all.  I ran out of motivational things to say a long
   time ago, but I do still want to touch base with everybody.
   Obviously things picked up a lot while Beonca was here, due
   in large part to her taking a major role in most of the RP
   on the mud.  With her gone, I'm afraid that we're going to
   see a near-instant drop in activity.

   To try and stave that off, Varulv is putting together a
   series of ideas (with different groups of people), and I'm
   very hopeful that it'll be a success and we'll continue to
   be active.  If you're not one of the people involved in
   his projects, there's still lots you can do to help, if you
   have time.  The easiest thing with the fastest, most satisfying
   results is helping us on the ubermap.  We're flying on that
   thing, and there are a number of jobs depending on what you
   want to do.  It's cool, honest.  Otherwise, you can help us
   make forms for combat, write a good list of spells you'd like
   to see coded, or write suggestions for additions to the talent
   lists (either chan or nonchan, up to you).

   One thing that I've noticed here is that it's not so much
   the finishing of anything that gets players active - it's
   being active while it's being worked on.  Players keep playing
   even though many times their big RP doesn't finish, or their
   personal ideas don't happen for whatever reason.  So, with
   that in mind, I'm asking everybody to contribute whatever they
   can, when you can.  If you only have time to handle the day-to
   -day stuff for your dept, that's still great.  I just want to
   ask that everybody do something - and if you've got nothing to
   do cuz your dept is quiet, then please volunteer with something
   else.  Just please don't idle.  Let players (and other imms)
   see you be active.  Talk on channels, gecho, pop in, goof off
   with them sometimes and othertimes let them know what you're
   working on.  The more active each of us is, the more inclined
   everybody is to play (and work) here.  So please, please, make
   yourself visible to everybody and be a part of what's going on.
   And update your imp(s) on what you're up to, please!

   Thanks much,
   -Nicodemus

4	20	4373	4331	1109864228	Nicodemus	1805	saving	Well, hell.  Mae, my best guess is that you didn't do an OLC save,
but stuff like this does happen sometimes anyway for odd reasons
(the BP is possessed, sometimes).  Typing 'yes' to the 'do you
wish to save this room internally' question is not enough - type
yes to that, and then periodically do a:
redit save <zone number you're working on>

For Tar Valon, it'd be `1redit save 90`7, `1redit save 91`7, and `1redit
`1save 92`7, I believe.  If you edit zone, object or mob files, you need
to do a `1zedit save 90`7, etc.

If at any time you want to see which files need to be saved
that way, type `1olc`7.  That'll list 'em.  Be aware though that
using this command when another builder is in an OLC menu, like
redit, is gonna crash the BP.  So be careful :p

So sorry about the lost work.  I thought I'd told everybody about

4	9	4396	4393	1110766148	`&Vivianne	3295	`#H`3igh `#R`3anking `#C`3haracters`7	  If you have a character of High Seat rank or higher, or a
military character of high rank, such as the Captain-General
or the Marshal-General, much more will be expected of you than
those of lower ranks.  Such positions come with responsibility,
and while the position is responsibility, it can still be a
lot of fun.  There are a few instances when you must come to
your GL first, before you take certain courses of action.  I
will go into further detail below.

`#M`3arriage`7

  If your high-ranking character wishes to marry, you MUST come
to me first so that I can be aware of your intention, and make
any appropriate changes to rank.  I am even willing to NPC a
Magistrate or other representative to do the ceremony if it is
so desired. High ranking characters must follow the guidelines
of the country in which he or she resides.  For instance, if
it is inappropriate for a Prince to marry a commoner, such a
marriage will not be allowed unless you wish to lose your rank.

`#T`3roop `#M`3ovements`7

  If you are planning any sort of troop movement which goes
beyond your normal number of retainers, you must come to your
GL first.  I will need to know exactly how many troops you are
planning to move, where you are planning to move them, and why.
You must also submit this information to the War Department, or
`1your troops will not be moved!`7  If you fail to notify the
GLs or the War Department, it will only cause confusion and
may result in nulled roleplay and delays in your plans.  If
you follow the guidelines, it will make things much smoother.
You must also notify the rulers of the nations your army will
be passing through so that they may choose whether or not to
take action, and what type of action they wish to take.  This
is why I, as the GL, need to know so that such movements can
be done in a realistic manner.

`#D`3eath`7

  If you are a high-ranking character, and you have been ICly
killed, or if you simply wish to kill off your character, I
need to be aware that it has been done, naturally, and whether
or not you will have a character of similar status in the guild
to replace your killed PC.  At this point, having obtained a high
ranking character, it is generally likely that you can have a
character of similar rank, unless you conducted yourself poorly
at the end.  You may not, however, create a character with the
exact same rank you lost.  For instance, if you die as Queen
of Cairhien, you cannot create a new character who is also Queen
of Cairhien.  However, you might be Queen of Illian, or Princess
of Arad Doman, or a similiarly high rank in another realm. Or,
you can create a lower-ranked character in the same realm, and
try to work your way back up to the position through roleplay,
provided you are not doing so as OOC vengeance against your IC
killer.

`3Major Changes/Events`7

  Any major changes or events you are planning, as a high-ranked
character, should also be run by me first as well. These are
things such as starting a war with Amadicia, or remodeling the
Sun Palace ICly, or building a memorial garden, etc.  Mostly, such
things can simply be sent to me in the form of an update, which
I can have posted.  Also, I am more than willing to help further
your plots and events by NPCing or otherwise making connections
for you that you may not have otherwise had.

  For major changes or events, it would be VERY WISE to LOG any
and all roleplay pertaining to it, in case someone has a gripe.
That way, you have it all documented, and can present it to me
if I need it in order to clarify something or resolve any
misunderstandings.  Hold onto all your mails and correspondance
in regards to such events, because you never know when you will
need them!

`#D`3uty`7

  As a high-ranking character, you have a duty to your country,
and this cannot be stressed enough.  If you are a High Seat,
for the most part, you will be expected to remain in your own
homeland, overseeing House matters, and assisting your monarch
in the running of the realm.  If you are a Prince or Princess,
you may have a bit more freedom, because you can act as a sort
of ambassador, or act on behalf of your monarch.  If you are
a monarch, leaving your homeland should be a very `1rare`7 thing
and should definitely be run by your GL first.  You must have
good cause to do so.  If any high-ranking character leaves his
or her own country, or wishes to, it must be pre-approved by
me first.  I need to know the reasons why, if nothing else. If
you wish to leave, I am not going to stop you for the sake of
RP, but if someone takes your Throne while you are away, it's
not my problem.  If you are not able to do the primary duty
of your rank, you will lose it, and it will be given to someone
else who can.

`3Have Fun!`7

  For the most part, I just want to encourage everyone with
a high-ranking character to `1have fun`7.  I know that, at times,
it can see
4	20	4553	4553	1116262800	Jake	5770	Headsup	Yeah.. we're not sure what's happened, or why, atm.  The
ubermap is intact where it's supposed to be, but the BP
isn't running it.  It's reverted back to the MM2 backup
files, which far as I know is about impossible unless
it was forcibly set on purpose.  Hale and I are looking
into it.  Til then, please stay off the - there's
nothing to do there atm anyway.

It has it's own codeswitch script now, seperate from the main port.

4	20	4567	4567	1117160141	Nicodemus	1805	`#F`3inishing the `#U`3bermap`7	The ubermap is nearing completion, so it's time to
look at what still needs to be done before we can port
it to the main port, here.  Several of you are finishing
up on your current zones - the work looks amazing.
There's simply no comparison to the new areas and the
old ones.  That became really, really clear to me when
I went into the old Alindaer zone and did some work on
it so it hooked up correctly to the new Tar Valon (there
was a goof there that I didn't notice til last night).
Great Job, you guys. :>

What's still to be done?

`^*  `7Maelyn's right - we missed two of the villages
   and bridges to Tar Valon - the south most one, and
   the south-west one, whatever it's called.  Mae, I
   went through and changed the color codes to the
   guard towers and the entrances to Tar Valon - you
   didn't need to keep the ones I'd left - they were
   just notes to whoever was gonna be making 'em :p I
   replaced the Tar Valon ones with the color scheme
   you're using throughout.

`^*  `7The White Tower.  I'm constructing that now,
   but it's gonna be up to you guys to descript it.
   Syrah's in charge of that, but if you guys could
   help her out (see what she wants) that'd help a lot.
   This is the last major zone to do before we go live.

`^*  `7The countryside. *cracks knuckles* I'm gonna
   do most of what's left myself, but if you guys
   could finish your assigned countryside zones (the
   ones around Cairhien, Tar Valon and Caemlyn), then
   we should be good to go.

After these descs are done, we'll have a few days to go
through and look for anything major that we missed.  On
a project this large, I wouldn't be surprised in the
slightest if there are a couple blank rooms in the middle
of no-where or something.  Additionally, Alindaer needs
to be glanced over again.  I've tried to fix it on several
occasions, and frankly, it's so messed up that I get
disgusted and fed up with it quickly :p Most of the huge
mistakes are fixed, but there are still many more minor
ones, and a few rooms that're blank.  I've fixed most of
the mislinkings (there were many).  I'll be eternally
grateful to anybody that can take the reins and fix some
of the obvious stuff there.

Assuming that's all done, we have two more things left:
purging exits, and easter eggs.  I want to remove many
of the exits into the rivers, so that you can only
cross them at strategic points on the map.  That'll be
neat for manuevering armies, which is already fully
designed and just needs to be coded.  The easter eggs are
gonna be part of a quest, and an incentive for people
to explore the map.  I'm hiding a series of thoroughly
ridiculous OOC rooms to the actual map, and I'm hiding
them via mislinkings and teleporters, and some other
tricks.  They're jokes, and finding one of 'em is gonna
be worth a lot of qps.  If you guys have any requests
or ideas for 'em, lemme know.  There's gonna be about
one in every two countryside zones.

Anywho, this is the plan.  Lets buckle down and knock
this thing out.  I plan on posting a 'we expect to have
this in by X date' note soon on proj show.  I'd like
to actually be able to have it done by the date we
pick, if for no other reason than that may be a first. :>

Thanks for reading this obnoxiously long post!

of rooms to get there and make them all one zone (the current
BT zone is almost totally empty), and stick the whole thing
in the ubermap.  What would be better (and faster) tho is if I
set aside the zone and a group of the asha's picked and chose
how they wanted to adjust it, and we can build the thing up
that way (so they can expand their tiny zone if they want).

   Tower zone with me? I'm going to try bang it out now.

4	24	4707	4707	1137604857	Duren	9	Updates	A few things:

 - I created a CVS respository for the lib and public_html directories.
 - I setup remote CVS.  If you want to be able to work offline on files in src, public_html, or lib,
   see http://tymemud.com/coding/  for directions on setting this up.
 - I configured MySQL to allow remote connections, and I also locked down the server a little by setting
   a root password.  From now on, you'll need to do: "mysql -uroot Tyme -p" and enter the password to
   access the database.  (I set it to the same as the shell password.)
 - I updated the MM32 code to compile on the GCC 3.3.x compiler, as well as maintaining compatibility
   with version 2.9.6.  Hopefully this means that no matter what server the code needs to run on, it
   should compile.

As a side note, the world files are included in the lib repository, and currently hold the MM3 version
of world files.  I setup the builderport directory so that it's able to commit to this repository, so
from now on, when areas are created on builderport, and need to be copied over to the live port, they
should be done just like source code is done.  You commit the copy on builderport to the repository,
then you cd to the world folder on the live port, and do a cvs update.  This makes it easier to maintain
'versions' of the various world files, and easier to revert back to an older version if we want to.

Since public_html is also in the repository, the same idea applies there.  Anytime you want to make a
change to the website, you should probably avoid making it directly in the public_html folder.  Go to
your own public_html folder under your own username (IE: /Muds/Tyme/home/duke/public_html).  Check
out a copy of public_html using remote CVS, make your changes, test them, then commit them back
to the repository once you're sure they work OK.  Then login as tyme, and do a cvs update
in the main public_html.

   new world map online.  So.. welcome to the new map. :p If you want to see what
   it looks like, the map and some explanation is posted at:
   `^http://www.engr.umd.edu/~maeillo/index2.htm`7

   Right now, Caemlyn, Tar Valon, Cairhien, Alindaer, Aringill, and some guild
   areas and the connecting roads/countryside are online, but outside of that
   big triangle, everything is not accessible to players just yet.  It's all
   there, but it's going to be an ongoing process to enable these zones one-by-
   one.  Syrah is the main POC for stuff that's missing, so if you want to know
   why you can't find your house, see her and she'll fix it.  This was a pretty
   major deal, so doubtless we missed some things.  The idea is that we'll
   continue to re-add popular zones from MM2 and MM3 as we go.  In most cases,
   this won't take too long, but it will take a couple of volunteers.  If you're
   interested, please see Syrah.

   A huge thank you to those of you that helped with the Ubermap - I'll probably
   try and document who did what but for right now I'll just say a special thanks
   to Maelyn, who redid the entire island of Tar Valon in accordance with the
   zoomed-in map in one of the books.  I'm a huge fan of the Ogier Grove there,
   which was courtesy of Phaedra, and I believe Sadren did the surrounding
   countryside around TV, along with Nenae, who did Caemlyn.  I did the woods
   north of Caemlyn.  Also, a special thanks to Lucardo, who's original idea for
   a 'mini-continent-map that we can move armies around on' grew into this
   ridiculously huge thing we've got here today.  It has a lot of things that
   need to be filled in, but it allows us to do all kinds of things with the
   combat code that we could never have done with the old map.  Picture laying
   seiges to cities by actually surrounding the entire city with army mobs,
   or trying to sneak your own armies across huge borders into enemy nations.

   Hope you enjoy.  Since the recall functions will no longer work for some
   locations, we imms will be happy to trans you where you need to go.

0	0	4909	4906	1159744887	Nicodemus	1805	Update	   We're in the process of enabling zones that we need that either didn't come
   through for whatever reason or that we didn't bring through with the first
   batch.  Player houses are halfway there, and the missing ubermap zones are
   enabled on the BP.  I need to do some of the guild areas, and when they're all
   on the BP correctly, I'll port the whole thing over at once.

   Before anybody else tries, due to a row of missing zones, it is currently not
   possible to walk between all of the cities - ask for a trans if you need one.
   I've readded the zones on the BP but we need to hook the exits up.  They'll
   be brought in at the same time as the houses and the SC guild area, and whatever
   other areas people speak up about.

0	0	4911	4908	1159761653	Wyl	87	East of Caemlyn	East of Caemlyn used to be a forest.

In said forest, north of the road a bit, was:

the Wolfkin guild area
the Tinker guild area
Dugoth's cave

These would now be in 640, between 25 and 36.

I understand, we're trying to go with a book-map,
so 04-15 would be preferable.

I volunteer myself for helping to re-link the
two zones, and the 'house.'

0	0	4912	4908	1159763222	Cathbad	162	`!Guildhouse`0	There used to be an Illuminator Chapterhouse
near Caemlyn.  This was to make it easier for
Guildees to participate in the Caemlyn-centric
mud RP.

This would be in tile 640,
number 74, 82, or 84, most likely.

Would it be possible to include, if not the
chapterhouse as it existed, then a desc for
that square listing it as the Illuminator
Chapterhouse of Caemlyn, not from the books?

This would help square away RP issues of
Illuminators being out of their chapterhouse
where they prettymuch live/work/play.

If a desc needs to be written, or an old area
linked, I'll do it.  Someone may need to talk
me through the steps, though.

0	0	4925	4908	1160486193	Jerod	5217	Various Guild Areas	The entirity of the guild tower is missing obviously, including the initial guild
rooms for Asha'man and Daes.  The Asha'man guild area needs to be reinstated
alone with the recall point.  The Council's guild area, along with the Queen's 
Palace and the Halls of Justice is missing.  The Council's guild area may be difficult
to reconnect, given the fact that its central room connects to others across the city
the Oval Plaza and the Barracks to name 2.

Anyway, thats all I can think of right now, other than the strip of zones separating 
Cairhien and Tar Valon from Caemlyn.  At the moment, there is no way for a player
to reach the shining walls, save for being transferred there by an Imm.

0	0	4927	4908	1160529937	Jake	5770	Upgrade #2	   I've replaced the missing row of zones and placed markers for
   all the roads, even though many of the road-rooms still have
   default descs.  For ease of use, once you start traveling on
   a road, the two directions that the road goes in are highlighted
   in the title, so you can walk pretty fast without having to
   read the desc or without accidently wandering off the trail.
   I think we may rename some of the roads so they include the
   names of the cities at either end instead of the bookish way
   we've named them here (it gets confusing - to me, anyway).

   At any rate, you can now walk from Caemlyn to Tar Valon to
   Cairhien to Aringill and just about anywhere in between.
   Obviously there's still lots to be done (like placing the
   rest of the rivers and descripting more rooms), but this
   is the general layout.  Also, Syrah has brought over the rest
   of the housing zones, so those should be good to go now, too.

0	0	4928	4928	1160537459	Jake	5770	`@R`2equest for `@R`2oom `@D`2escs`7	   Hey all,

   We could really use a hand with descripting the new map rooms.  There are a lot of them,
   and if anybody would be willing to spend some time writing descs and just sending them
   to me, I'll 'build' them myself to minimize the hassle.  Obviously we don't have a whole
   lot in the way of rewards to offer right now, but I will give out QPs that can be traded
   for exp or can be stored towards MM3.2 eq.  I do ask that they be high quality
   descriptions with good grammar - we're trying to make a map so well done that it blows
   all our old zones out of the water.  I appreciate anything you can send in, even if it's
   just three or four rooms.

   Descriptions should not include references to 'you', specific animals ("A deer looks at
   you" is bad, but "A trampled path through ferns indicates deer nearby" is ok), or
   weather, since all that is cheesy and can change based on how the RP is going.  You
   know, unless it's the top of a mountain and it's always snowy there. :p Each room is
   'large' - like several miles, so think large scale.  An example:

`2The feel of the wood changes drastically, as does the smell.
This part of the forest is old - older than that of the
surrounding area, and the air is dry and lifeless.  The trees
have enormous girth, but are of no great height.  Gnarled and
covered only in patches by dry, peeling bark, they moan and
crackle continuously.  The floor is littered not with leaves or
ferns, but with small rocks and dead wood that will not decompose.
The forest clings to life only by refusing to admit that death
is upon it.`7

   Please, please give us a hand. :p Mail 'em in to Nicodemus.

   Thanks!

0	0	4933	4933	1161132986	Nicodemus	1805	`^I`6mportant`7: `^P`6lease `^R`6ead`7	Alright everybody, got some big news that will either infuriate or excite.  With
the goal of fixing some things that are broken, stupid, or just hard for players,
we're making some large-scale adjustments.  The result is, we hope, that our
guilds (for both current and hopefully future members) will be in a better
position to interact with each other.  Some large-scale auths are involved, and
I don't expect everybody will like them.  I feel they are good solutions, and
even though the implementation is a little premature, it worked out ok for the
ubermap and plus it's going to be harder if we wait until we have more players.
Here goes.

Through act of Luc and I, Altara has fallen to the SC, and the country of
Murandy is all but won.  Northern Altara is under contention from the DS and
Whitecloaks.  Ghealdan remains home to the Dragonsworn (even though we don't
currently have any), and the WC still control Amadicia.  Murandy's fall will
be presented through updates in the immediate future (its fall is imminent).
Because of the effort it took to conquer Altara and Murandy, the SC will be
forced to spend a long time regrouping and gathering their resources,
which will allow for more actual RP instead of aggressive attacks into
Caemlyn.  The end result of all this is that the SC are in a position to
impact the RP of the 'actual' part of the mud, and the WC and DS (should we
get any) will be in an RP hotspot, as will anybody in Caemlyn.  If you
check your maps, players can still travel freely between Caemlyn and Illian,
and the Whitecloaks can still get between Amadicia and Caemlyn, provided they
make it through the DS troops.  The SC will almost certainly be sending recon
missions into Caemlyn, and it's up to everybody to react as they like.

Lucardo and Parol are updating the war rules based on the ubermap grid.
Since that grid is implemented now, we should have an improved ability to
wage wars over this, should the RP require any.

Thanks! Have a nice day.
-Nicodemus, heavy-handed imp

0	0	4935	4933	1161219864	Jerod	5217	1	I say this because, while it has been pointed out that Murandy was
weak, and therefore an easy target, it also stands as buffer
between the Seanchan and Andor.  This means that one of the
strongest states in Randland has no direct connections to Seanchan
land, and is not 'threatened' by them yet, thus will more than 
likely hesitate to consider them a threat upon which action is
necessary.  With the elimination of Amadicia instead, they have
both closed a gap in their lines, as well as having eliminated one
of the more dangerous threats to their flank.  

Taking Altara and Amadicia would then leave them with only one
flank in danger from an appreciable enemy, that is to say Illian.
Whereas, this attack on Murandy, rather than Amadicia has left
them with an appreciable threat on three fronts, as well as a less
organized force on a fourth front.  A move that I think many would 
consider dangerous.


I realize that the choices made in this case were for the benefit
of RP, rather than strategy, a way to introduce Seanchan to 
Caemlyn so that they could RP.  I would put forth however that 
more likely this will lead to RP that will end badly for those who
choose to play Seanchan.  My reason for saying this is thus, with
Murandy between Andor and Seanchan held territories, there was no
percieved direct threat, and thus Seanchan scouts would not be in
direct danger simply for being in Caemlyn.  With Seanchan
encroaching on Andoran borders, and refugees entering the city,
anyone who is connected with the Seanchan will be considered as a
direct threat to the Crown the moment they step into the country,
and will be treated as such by the authorities.  This will lead to
imprisonment at best for those discovered(Seanchan are not 
unrecognizable), and death for most who are caught as spies.

I have some other problems regarding the planned RP and the
characters who will be involved in our city, but those are
personal issues that I can explain if you ask me directly.

Anyway, these are my thoughts,
Jerod

PS This should be first:
If this has not been already taken for IC, I feel the need to say 
that I have a problem with this plan from an OOC standpoint.
Strategically, this move doesn't make sense to me.


4	37	5178	5178	1173136048	Balinor	107	`&Chain of Command`7	Chain of command can be a difficult concept with two separate chains of
command within the guild (Gaidin and Tower Guard), as ICly, the chains
of command are interlinked. This is how it works:

1. Gaidin trainee ranks and Tower Guard soldier ranks have no authority
   over each other. Thus, a Bannerman can't tell an Initiate Trainee
   what to do and vice-versa.

2. Tower Guard officer ranks -may- tell Gaidin trainee ranks what to do,
   but this is only in extreme circumstances. Generally, they don't.

3. Gaidin graduate ranks have direct authority over Tower Guard soldier
   ranks, without exception. This situation will be encountered often,
   such as when a Gaidin orders a Tower Guard to apprehend someone or
   something of that nature.

4. Gaidin graduate ranks and Tower Guard officer ranks have no authority
   over each other. If there is a dispute, generally it is resolved by
   going over the other's head (i.e. to a more senior Tower Guard officer
   or, in the other case, to go to the Master at Arms about the Gaidin).

These rules are written in stone and will be enforced so that there are
boundaries that define exactly how the two chains of command interact.
Thank you for following these guidelines.

4	20	5183	5183	1173256972	Valkaria	2445	White Tower Update	Hey everyone! This is Sadren, in case anyone doesn't know who my
alts are. I'm wondering if anyone still reads this thing. :)

Anyway, I wanted to thank Nico and Duren for updating and getting
the work I had put in on the mud. We now have about fifteen rooms
put in, all of which are great spots for RP.

I am turning my direction away from the gardens and stables now,
and I started work on the Library, as well as the Colonnade leading
to the western courtyard. The Library is about 9 rooms, and I
connected it to the Brown Ajah halls through a skyway.

I also plan on creating a hedge maze near the eastern entrance to
the White Tower. Anyone have any tips on how to make a really
good maze? :)

I am trying to finish most of the outside before I start going
into the Tower proper. Also, Balinor, Rosabelle, and Lio have
all taken an interest in helping out, but they need to be given
work zones on builder port. Balinor doesn't know OLC at all,
and Rosabelle and Lila need a refresher course. I'd be happy
to give it, if you want. :D

Anyways, things are going well.

We are switching back to a dynamic IP address (Because it costs three times as much to have one), but
this means our IP will change as soon as we switch, and it will change periodically after that.
So it's very important that you do not connect using the IP.  Make sure you always connect using
the hostname 'tymemud.com'

4	22	5512	5512	1204320190	Duren	9	Promotional Idea:	
Ok, this idea requires a few moving parts, and it may never get off the ground because of this.

The idea is this:  We should try to 'schedule' RP events/quests on a regular basis.  Duh, right?
But lets take it one step further:  Lets advertise this event not only on proj show, but also
on the website, and mudconnector.com, and topmudsites.com, as well as other MUD websites.  These
postings should be made at least 3 days in advance of the event to provide adaquate time for people
to find out about it.

So you're thinking:  Ok, that seems like a good idea.
Well, lets not stop there.  We should also make sure we have someone with the authority to approve
basic backgrounds for new players at these events, since presumably, we'll probably have quite a few newbies
right before and during the event.  We should make the process of getting them up to speed and getting
them involved in the RP event as painless as possible.

Now, I know Parol and Kheldon have been trying to get a tournament going.  Ideally I would see one of
these events scheduled at the same time as his tournement, with the possibility of 'blending' the events
in case either event alone doesn't pull in enough support to justify running it.  Hopefully the combined
events would have enogh player interest to make something interesting out of it.

I think if we do these on a regular basis (once or twice a month at least), I think we'll
be amazed at the number of new players we start seeing.

Please comment with your feelings about this.

Thanks,

Now that I'm living -in- Austin (rather than 40 miles north in the middle of nowhere)
and have a nice fast internet connection, I've decided to relocate the server to my place
so that it won't be a 3 hours drive away if anything happens.

Unfortunately, this means that we'll be down during the 3 hour drive it takes
to get the server here, plus some time to get it all set up.

I have the server scheduled to shut down at 11:00am Central time
tomorrow Jan 16th.  I hope to have things up and running again by 5pm.

I know there's been a lot of downtime lately and this is only adding to it.
I also haven't been around as much since I moved for several reasons,
all of which are really good for me, such as a girlfriend, working out
every day, cooking all my food from scratch (No eating out), and losing
weight.  I graduated with my Masters degree in December, and I should be
starting a new job in the next few weeks.  Once things settle down and become
more routine, I should be around more again.

Sorry I've been away so long.  Been dealing with some RL 
issues.  Things are back on track again now, so I should be available 
more often if anyone needs me for anything.  I'm usually here in the 
evenings between 6 pm to Midnight CST and on the weekends.  I'd still 
like to see this game come back to life, and will be starting work on 
my building projects again.  If anyone wants to help with building 
projects, please let me know.  Here is a list of what needs to be done:


`5Mobprogs`7 - We need people willing to learn how to do mobprogs to make 
automated quests for players to do while the player base is low.  These 
quests could offer such things as teaching skills, scavenger hunts, mobs 
that have different reactions to characters based on who they are, etc.  
These are very important for us right now, because it will give something 
to players to do while we await the finishing of the new combat system.

`2Ubermap`7 - There are a lot of rooms that need to be desced on the Ubermap.  
The Ubermap is basically a nearly-to-scale map of the area between Tar 
Valon, Cairhien and Andor according to RJ's maps in the books.  Every 
square of it is going to be open for players to explore, and it will be 
important to pay attention to room descriptions in order to figure out 
where you are.  We need people who are willing to just do descriptions.  
The rooms are already set up.  We'll give you access to the Ubermap, and 
then you can desc your heart out.  Must be willing to do mundane things
like forests, rivers, fields, farmlands, hills, etc. though of course
you're welcome to add interesting things such as bridges or other cool
landmarks here and there to help folks find their way around.  The Uber-
map is currently only 15 percent complete so we really need help with it.

`3Cairhien`7 - Cairhien needs to be gone over with a fine-tooth comb to
make sure all the rooms connect properly.  The Sun Palace is also in
need of revamping, as it apparently has stairs that go nowhere.  Also,
there are a number of shops that are not linked to the Cairhien grid
any longer and those need to be re-linked.  Any player interested in 
helping out with Cairhien, please let me know and this project will be 
delegated out.  Cairhien is currently about 75 percent complete

`1Caemlyn`7 - This is again where mobprogs come in.  We want to make some
newbie-friendly quests for new players to get to know their way around
and to generally make Caemlyn a more fun place to explore.  Some descs
of rooms could probably be revamped as well.  This project is only about 
10 percent finished.

Things I am Finishing:

`6Non-Combat Eq`7 - I am currently going over all the wearable items and
making sure that they don't have any typos and things like that.  This
is about 50 percent done and will likely be finished in the next month.

`&White Tower`7 - The White Tower is nearly complete, about 90 percent.  Just need 
to put in a few more automated quests/mobprogs, finish the basement area 
and need to finish the Warder Tower.  Elaida's Palace is nearly complete.  
A maze has been added to the gardens.  I will be finishing the White Tower 
area hopefully in the next month, if not sooner.

`!Shops`7 - Once the non-combat equipment is created and proofread, shops need 
to be made and/or edited in Caemlyn and Tar Valon (and eventually Cairhien 
once it's relinked again) so that players can purchase the new equipment. 
There will be shops dedicated specifically to newbie equipment, and shops 
dedicated to various equipment slots.  This project has not yet been
started.

So there you have it.  My Building Report.  I would appreciate help from anyone
who cares to assist.  There is still much to be done, but as you can see, we know
what needs to be done.  We just need to do it. :)

I developed a web based client that does not use any direct TCP connection to the game at all.  So if
you have any internet access at all, you can access the game at:

http://tymemud.com/ajaxclient.php

The other nice thing about the ajax client is that it can piggyback an existing connection.
So you can stay online at home, go to work, load up the page and see what would be on your
screen at home.

The ajax client does create a lot of database data, as all text displayed on your screen gets
dumped into a MySQL database where the webpage can load it up.  For this reason you have to
specifically enable it in game by typing:

option ajax

Have fun!

These are the more common types of candidates seeking to train with 
the warders. These are people with high ideals and goals for themselves 
and their own place in the Wheel. 
`
`2Warder Template #2 `7- The Romantic 
Dazzled by old stories of heroism against the battle of evil, the 
Romantic dwells within all the elaborated myths about the Gaidin.
`
`2Warder Template #3 `7- The Dutiful 
There is little passion outside the cold brim of duty, and these are in 
truth the "Cold, Leashed Dogs" of the Gaidin that most people hear 
about. They often see themselves more as tools than maybe the Aes 
Sedai does, not caring much for their own value and often quite morbid 
in nature.
`
`2Warder Template #4 `7- The Cryptic 
Many kinds of people fit into this category, yet what all of these are 
bound to have in common is the fact that at one point or another, 
something happened in their lives that made them feel like repaying it 
in a way by joining the Gaidin. 
`
`*TG\Army Template #1 `7- The Devoted 
Aside from the regular Warder-candidates there are those who seek a 
more structured life-style, the Tower Guard or the Army instead. The 
guidance to this service is like a beacon for these, clearing the path 
and allowing the person to tread upon the lane of Light within the ranks. 
`
`*TG\Army Template #2 `7- The Unemployed 
These men are often rather simple in terms of personality.  They are often 
unhindered by glorious desires to become something special, like heroes or 
high-ranking officers: they merely wish to earn a living by the means available.
`
`*TG\Army Template #3 `7- The Obligated (Honor and Tradition, Nobles)
The Nobility are often in the habit of sending their sons to be trained 
at the White Tower. These sons are sometimes the heirs of their 
families and thus never intend to bond.  Some remain as Tower Guard 
while others may return home to their families.

You MUST submit your background to the Daes GL for approval of

tested for the ability to channel.  If she is found to be able to channel,

1	0	6014	6007	1362613764	Rissa	7249	The Asylum Seeker	A woman of noble blood is often given in an arranged marriage, with 
or without her consent. Most often, this marriage is accepted as a part 
of her duty to her family. A few women, though, rebel against this 
arrangement. Some object strongly enough to leave their family and 
come to the Tower for shelter. Similar to women in the Middle Ages 
who might run away to a convent rather than marry that ugly old Earl, 
women in this land may run to the Shining Walls of the White Tower 
for refuge. They often have no goal other than to defy their family. 
`
At other times, a nobleman or noblewoman may be threatened in his/her 
native lands (perhaps from an invading army or internal upheaval) and 
come to the Tower seeking asylum from his/her enemies. 
`
To be accepted as an asylum seeker, you will need to gain the approval 
of the Amyrlin (a role-played audience)
-
*Note - As with all women the Tower encounters, the asylum seeking 
woman is tested to see if she can channel when she arrives, and if so, 
she is placed on the path to Aes Sedai. Others may be allowed (at the
Amyrlin's discretion) to remain as guests.

`8"`#Wolfkin`8"`7
`
This thread on template show will be dedicated to the Wolfkin
guild and their character templates. Each template will be
placed on the same thread as a new comment to keep things
more compact and easy to use. Before continuing on, here is a
short explanation of who the Wolfkin are.
`
`#"`3It was once said that before even the Nym and the Ogier were
born into the world, man had a link with the beasts of the earth,
and in particular, the wolves. Although these men and women took
no formal name, they are lumped under the title of 'Wolfkin.'
Somehow, they have uncovered their link with their furry
friends once more, allowing their minds to somehow communicate
with the wolves as well as to enter the World of Dreams, known
as Tel'Aran'Rhiod to those schooled in esoteric lores. The
danger of being a Wolfkin is all too clear, though. As has
happened from time to time, a person may fall victim to the
lust of the wolfish side and embrace their animality rather
than their humanity. To most knowledge, once that bridge is
crossed it burns as well. With the Wolfkin, they must always
balance carefully the instincts of an animal with the reason
of a human, a delicate line to walk.`#"`7

`
`1Step 1)`7 Decide to seek Wolfkin, make it your overwheming passion ;)
`1Step 2)`7 Come up with an appropriate background and submit this to the
`7        GL's (currently Miniver and Lironah) for approval.
`1Step 3)`7 Find yourself `#3`7 sponsors.
`1Step 4)`7 Get guilded, be the envy of all your friends.
`
`!Multiguilded Wolfkin Seekers`7
`
`1Step 1)`7 Realise that being Wolfkin doesn't just mean cool new
        abilities for your character to use in their RP. It involves
        effort, thought, and skill to execute properly.
`1Step 2)`7 Submit a background and justification as to how your
        character might manage to be both Wolfkin and a member of your
        other guild without sacrificing skill in one or the other.
`1Step 3)`7 Get authorization from all GL's of your current guilds then
        wait for a response from the Wolfkin GLs. They will discuss
        this with your current GLs and likely ask around amoung others
        as to your skill and ability.
`1Step 4)`7 Remember that even do you get authorization in all earlier
        steps that is still no guarentee you can or will be guilded.
        The Wolfkin GL will assign requirements as appropriate, be
        they sponsors, RP logs, RP levels, whatever might be deemed
        appropriate for your personal situation. Your requirements may
        not be the same as another persons. They may seem more
        difficult, or not, but they will be geared towards not only
        testing your abilities but also your commitment and desire.
`1Step 5)`7 Get guilded, if you're lucky ;)

`!Note:`7 Do not RP having goldeneyes until you have been given
      express permission from the GLs.

`
`1THE MAD DOG`7
`
`8Quote: `!"`1For a moment Noam stared at the opening. Abruptly he darted
        out of the cage, running on all fours, but with surprising
        agility. Out of the cage, out of the shed, and into the night.`!"`7
`
Book Example: Noam (The Dragon Reborn, Ch. 8 "Jarra")
`
Unfortunately, though no one yet really understands why, some who
join with the wolves can not manage to control it and their humanity
crumbles away like the bank of a raging river. To both wolves and
people this is not a good thing. They all seem to understand that for
a human to become a wolf in mind is not a natural thing and not
right when it happened. The best and only example of this aspect of
Wolfkin, the Mad Dog, is found in the character Noam in the books.
`
Tested by both Moiraine and Perrin, Noam was found to have lost all
connection to his former humanity. He was overwhelmed and lost within
the wolf nature of his mind, all pathways back to his former humanity
forgotten, hidden, or destroyed completely. The Mad Dog is no longer
human in anything except their physical shape. Their thoughts, 
desires, instincts, and passions are all those of a wolf with no
real memory or regard for those things they knew in their former life.
`
Like Noam, a Mad Dog is as liable to lash out at those they once
named friends or family as they are to lash out against strangers,
knowing nothing except that these strange people are dangerous to
them and that they should get away. Even the simplest task like
opening a door or speaking a word are lost to the Mad Dog unless it
is natural for a wolf to do. It is a truly saddening and painful
existence, being a wolf but never belonging and never even realising
the possible welcome to be found on the side of humans.

4	7	6184	6179	1380748310	`&Sa'narisa`7	3547	`!S`1ai'`!m`1an `&(`7Powerful`&) `!D`1amane `!S`1yllabus`7	Sai'man literally translates to "Powerful Blade".

At this level, the damane is one of the best-trained in the Empire.  These 
highly-trained Damane are honored with the Sai'man rank, and they are very often
given special privileges that your average damane never sees.  Better living
conditions, treats, ribbons, and they may even be owned by one of the Blood, or the
Empress herself.

I.  `&C`7omplex `&B`7attle `&W`7eaves

    a.  Control Weather -  If the damane has the ability to cloud dance, it will
                           be discovered in attempting to teach her this weave.
    a.  Hail Storm -       If the damane has the ability to control the weather,
                           (the cloud dancing talent), then she may learn this
                           weave.  This weave requires strong flows of Air and
                           Water.
    b.  Call Lightning -   If the damane has the cloud dancing Talent, she may
                           learn this weave.
    c.  Storm of Air -     Any damane of Sai'man strength may learn this weave.
    d.  Harm -             A damane must have a Talent for Healing in order to
                           learn this weave.  She must also have the required
                           'cause wounds' pre-requisite, and the 'cure wounds'
                           pre-requisite for that weave.  Unlike Aes Sedai,
                           Seanchan have no qualms about teaching this weave
                           to damane for use on humans.  If your damane is an
                           Aes Sedai and bound by oaths, she will not be able
                           to use this weave unless she feels her life is in
                           mortal peril, or only against Shadowspawn.
    e.  Thunderclap -      A damane may learn this weave if she has the Cloud
                           Dancing Talent.  This is a complex weave, which
                           requires delicacy and precision in all Five Powers.
    f.  Implode -          This is one of the deadlier weaves in a damane's
                           channeling arsenal.  It requires strength in Earth.
    g.  Firestorm -        One of the deadlier weaves.  The damane will create
                           a storm of fire and air, usually in tornado form,
                           though it can be varied in such a way as to cause
                           fireballs to rain down, or ribbons of fire to slice
                           through the air.
    h.  Eruption -         This is one of the deadlier weaves a damane is taught.
                           It requires a great amount of strength in Fire and Earth.
                           This can cause the earth to erupt in a violent manner,
                           usually with devastating consequences.  The stronger
                           the channeler, the more damage this weave causes.
    i.  Sap Energy -       This weave can only be taught to damane who have the
                           Healing Talent.  It also requires the pre-requisite
                           weave 'refresh'.
    j.  Infrigidation -    A powerful weave that can cause anything to freeze.
                           The stronger the channeler, the deadlier it can be.
                           It can also be used to freeze large areas of water,
                           it can be used to damage mundane weapons, and it can
                           be used in conjunction with other weaves.
II. `&S`7pecial `&T`7alents

     Some damane have special Talents.  Sometimes, these Talents manifest only
     after the sul'dam has worked with her for a time.  Sometimes, they are
     immediately apparent.  A sul'dam must -always- be on the lookout for rare
     talent in a damane.  Particular Talents the Seanchan value:

     1.  Cloud Dancing - As mentioned above, cloud dancing is highly valued
                         as a talent among damane.  A damane may be promoted to 
                         the Sai'man rank for this Talent once she is trained.  
                         Damane who can cloud dance are valued for their ability 
                         to aid ships, and to aid the growing of crops by controlling 
                         the weather.  They can also create highly destructive storms, 
                         and so are valued in sea battles especially.
     2.  Healing -       While no Seanchan would care to be touched by a damane to be
                         Healed, damane who have the Healing Talent are valued for their
                         ability to learn to use that ability to cause greater harm to
                         the enemy.  It is not a talent that is cultivated in damane
                         very often, if at all.
     3.  Foretelling -   This is a VERY rare Talent among damane, and currently, there
                         is only one damane known to have i
