Dammit.  That's the last time I try to download two songs
simultaneously, using a 56k connection.  :P  Y'see?  Big
cities rock.  High-speed connections and all.  *sighs dreamily*
Anyway.  I wrote my background!  Well, a third of it.  I guess
it will do for the time being, though.  I will expand upon it
later, until it's roughly 30000 lines long.  Mua hahaha!
That's the cool thing about small towns.  Nothin' else to do,
really.  :)  *smooch*  Seeya.  :)

`7Subj`6:`7 A wee bit of war and a wee bit of mud stuff
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Well, war stuff first, as that was first on the Subject


Tal and I have been discussing various plans to get stuff moving for the legion, and to (ultimately) get them in on a trip to the Andoran area to hang around there on a semi-permenant basis, for the sake of centralized rp.
save
We've come up with a plan for it, though I still need to speak with Varulv to get his okay, but the main thing I wanted to do before that, was see if some method of regrouping forces could not be established before hand. Of the several plans Tal and I worked out, all but one (which wasn't very viable) would require casualities on the side of the Legion, and probably more than a few. To avoid becoming a phased out entity without any force, we wanted to see if we couldn't work out some method that would ensure our restocking of men beforehand, even though there is no Economy out there to purchase such troops and training.

Now, on to the second thing, 

Several months ago I suggested to you the possibility of our linking with wotmud.org and combining forces. Unsuprisingly, (especially considering the number differences) they didn't much seem to care for the idea.
After looking around though, I still think the idea is not only a sound one, but a neccesary one, albeit with a targeted audience somewhat closer to home.
save
Going through the muds on topmudsites, there were some fourteen viable wotmuds that were RP based and at least on the surface, similiar to us (though there could be others, wotmud was the only one I checked)
Most disturbing of all, I found every last one of them to be in a similiar prediciment as we are. -none- had so many as twenty indivuals online.
Its akin to one big mud with rp in a dozen cities when its got support enough for perhaps one.

My sugestion would be to innitiate talks with these other muds about the possibility of merging our muds.
Concessions would no doubt have to be made to do such things like that, we can't just say "Hey, come to us!" and expect everyone to happily jump on board. But luckily the negotations at this point are your trouble as owner and imp, rather than mine *halo*
But the point is the same. If at all possible, I believe we ought to attempt to contact the admin of these MUDS and see how we could best combine all of us together. 
In addition to the other 14 rp muds around though, I would also suggest we speak with the admin of roleplaying boards, While they aren't live rp, we could perhaps (and probably even more easily) encorporate our and their groups.
Who knows though, the sad thing is, it probbably won't work. I figure its worth a try, but I know how reluctant I'd be to move to another place, even with the right carrots, or to dangle carrots to others. But I figure consolidating rp, Both for us in Caemlyn, and us as a wheel of time community would probably be the best plan. 
If you'd like, I'll draw up the initial greeting mail or whatever to speak with 'em, and give 'em to you to send, but that's only if you agree to think about pursuing this idea and don't want to spend the time to do so yourself innitially.  Anyhow, these are just my thoughts, and since I can't find you while you're online, I'm offerin' 'em up in a mail.

Ah, forgive the severely delayed response, but I never received

or some such thing like that... hopefully I'm not beating a dead horse
with my response. 

Yes, MiT is stagnating. I think we can all agree on that.
I do not, however, agree that Alicia's late payment (a whole 10 days,
the horror!) is a sure sign of her 'disinterest' ... She has a real
life and doesn't think of the game 24 hrs a day, it's easy to lose
track of time. Plus, I don't think MiT was in any danger of disconnection
from only 10 days of lag time in payment, I seem to recall a certain
time period a few years back in which MiT had not paid for 4-6 months,
yet was still up and running.

Sure, there are always people that think they can do a better job,
or think they know precisely where the problem lies and how to fix
it, but generally... those people don't know all of the story or
all of what has led up to that point. You are entitled to your thoughts
and opinions, Fredrik, no one can fault you for them. But, unless you've
got a better arguement and a better plan than jsut "be more active than
Alicia" I think a regime change at this point will only do more harm
than good. The mud needs to rebuild stability, not change even more
drastically.

Owl and Heron Ball 
The first of it's kind, the Owl and Heron Ball is being
carefully planned to cater to the variety of cultures
currently represented in Haven. The theme of the Owl and Heron Ball has been chosen to
be springtime. Elaborate costumes depicting animals
and flowers are already being constructed inside the 
keep. The Lady Caoilin an'Shinowa, put in charge of
the festivities, has taken careful attention to having
only the most skilled seamstresses and tailors 
employed to create the look of the Ball. 
The Great Hall and Haven Square are to be transformed into 
a springtime wonderland of trees and flowers. All of the elements
of an evening stroll beneath the stars will be employed.
The wives of the nobles currently in Haven are all a
buzz about what to wear and further, how to be certain
no one else is wearing it. 
Prizes will be given out for the best and most creative
costumes. Gleemen and Illuminators will be on hand to
provide entertainment in and outside of the keep so that
all may enjoy. 
Regardless, the evening promises to be enjoyed by all and
a well deserved respite before the campaign to retake
Malkier officially begins.

Ok, it still asks for comments... Is there any way to read those comments?

Also, there's no way to get to the voting page unless you have new topics
to vote on.  There needs to be a link added somewhere

If you type the wrong password in, it takes you to some wierd login page,
from there, no matter what user/pass you enter, it just redisplays that same page.

`7Subj`6:`7 my post

I would just like to start this with a bit of good news (of course all of
it could be good news to some of you, but we won't go into that)....
                                                                                                                                                                                  
Player pages are in. Go to http://tyme.envy.com/players.php and you will
find a link to Create/Alter your personal player page. To have picture up
you will need to link it to the site from somewhere else (unless you can
convince someone to upload it on to the server for you). I have put in a
forced size on the pictures, which is 130 pixels by 130 pixels. So as long
as your picture is a perfect square it should size down right. If you do
not want a picture then just leave it blank and a No Photo Available pic
will be put up in it's place.

So now on to the fun part of this post. I'm leaving, plain and simple. Here
are my reasons why. It is no longer fun to be here. The upper levels of the
staff can't make up their mind on what they want to do, nor can they get
things done in a reasonable amount of time. It's been close to a month since
the vote closed and Duren can't even say where in the timeline we will be
because he says he is waiting on Alicia to log in and discuss it. Sure that
is reasonable if she ever logs on, but it's been almost a month as well since
she last logged on. (Alicia, please don't try to tell me you log on every
day again and ask Duren if I want proof. I am a coder, I have access to syslogs
and the mysql database. I know when people have been on last if I want to talk
to them.)
                                                                                                                                                                                  
Another problem I have with this place is it isn't going anywhere. To put it
in Alicia's own words, "Stagnation is better than change just for the sake of
change." this was in regards to what she believed was my putting up the vote
on a whim. No no, while yes I did push for it to go up, I did take it to an
imp before I spent all that time writing the php to handle web voting.
                                                                                                                                                                                  
So you ask, why don't I do anything about it. I tried. I asked Alicia if I
could take the mud (as well as a number of other people in the past month
or two.) All she did was laugh and ruffle my hair as if I was some kid. Well
guess what, I'm gone now, ruffle someone elses hair for a while.
                                                                                                                                                                                  
So basically I'm tired. I've got no real time to devote here, but I gave up
sleeping many a time in the past to work here, and if it were worth it now
I would do it still. I was inspired a few weeks ago when I thought things
might happen and busted my ass to get that website up, wrote up the design
for the channeling system, and talked to plenty an older player who I keep
in contact with to get them to come back. Alot of them considered it if the
changes that we all thought were needed were going to happen. Well my hair
got ruffled. Thanks. You log on for one hour in a month and a half and just
ruffle my hair. yeah.....

So ladies and germs, I've taken it into my own hands, being the prankster that
I have always been, and have changed the Legion and Male Channelers guilds back
to the Band of the Red Hand and the Asha'man guilds respectively. The tags (channels
and such) for those are now RH and AM respectively as well. I say go play in the
book timeline, right around the end of book 6, which is where both of those guilds
would have come back in. It's a good place. There isn't too much open for question
at that point in the timeline and all the major players are in place for a fun time.
Of course I can't make such a deciscion, but it was damn fun to change the code.
                                                                                                                                                                                  
Take it easy, I'm off to work on a mud where things change, I get to make the changes
I feel are nessecary, and my co-workers are just as inspired if not more so to make
things work.

Of course I can't make such a deciscion, but it was damn fun to change the code.
                                                                                                                                                                                  
Take it easy, I'm off to work on a mud where things change, I get to make the changes
I feel are nessecary, and my co-workers are just as inspired if not more so to make
things work.

`7CC`6: `7Nicodemus Bethany 

  Timeline, I suggest Book 4.  Probably the end, so as to let the Aiel back into
the world.  Since the shift is supposed to bring back these guilds, yes?
* Reason 1)Andor and Cairhien are still free, allowing the DD to still have some
           wiggle room before the Iron Hand of Rand comes crashing down like a
           sledge hammer.
* Reason 2)Rand and Mat are still powerful enough at this point to begin both
           the BotRH as well as the Asha'man.  The amnesty can be declared in
           Tear, and men can go there for training.  Mat can also reform the
           Tairen army into the beginnings of the BotRH (as it was in part
           founded this way anyway).
* Reason 3)Rand can have his bastion of power, a bit away from the central
           RP zones (Cairhien/Andor/Tar Valon) and those following him would
           still have enough of a reason to be in these RP zones.
* Why?     Because this way, there are still enough PC driven forces to allow
           for some PC driven initives, as well there is enough Rand sloppily
           gaining power that things can be done there as well, from an admin
           standpoint.

`7CC`6: `7Shai'tan Duren Nicodemus Varulv 

This isn't something I'd expected to find myself doing, but I'm
writing this mail to make a case for the fall of Saldaea, a la Malkier.

ICly, of course, here is my reasoning.  I posted on the update board
quite some time ago that Saldaea was in danger of being overrun by the
shadow.  I personally warned the ruler of Saldaea, who has made no calls
for help from other borderland nations.  Regardless, the truth of the
matter is on the update board for any and all to see.  The legion, well
aware of Saldaea's plight (this came about partly at aratan's request),
has left for Aringill for OOC reasons, leaving Saldaea helpless.

This went unnoticed by me for the better part of a month, because of my
shitty internet connection.  But the fact is that the Shadow has been
building up troops and making preparations for the Malkier campaign.
Saldaea was originally intended as a feint to draw troops and attention
away from Malkier and into Saldaea, but now that the legion has all but
withdrawn from the borderlands as a whole, there is no reason to hold back.

At the very least, I would like to see the shadow break through Saldaea's
walls.  What happens from there would of course depend on the IC reactions
of other nations.  Saldaea doesn't have to fall like Malkier did, if more
troops are committed.  But I believe the possibility should be left open.

I attempted to mail you earlier and dont know if it went thru because i lost connection.
I am worried about the status of the mud. I have seen it going down hill for awhile now and it bothers me.
I realize it is not your fault, it was going down before you even obtained it. I have seen however the stress it has put on you. And am only assuming this is why you rarely log in anymore.
What I propose is to remove some of that stress if you allow. I would like to take payment over and attempt to turn the downward spiral around. I am able to log in from work (10 hours a day) give or take laptop recharge time of a couple hours, and am willing to put the time needed in.
I have been trying to get ahold of you for awhile now with no luck, so please email me at: burdett@covad.net
when you get the message. I would email you but forgot what your email was. I know you have been asked by others to have them take over payment. I am asking because i feel i can turn this around. I have been here as long as you if not longer, since april 95, and really think if this place as a second home. Recently however things have  not been to good here as we all know. I would like to change that. Please let me know what you think, and if you do decide to do this, do not feel that you have to leave, I do not want to change anything with staff. Thanks in advance.

Heya,
I want to do this so it doesn't sound like I am being rude.  In an August posting
on the proj show board (#12 I think) you mentioned the mudconnector as 
a place where the people would not understand Tyme's rp.   While I respect
your opinion I have to disagree with it.  Several people who post regularly on TMC 
have rped (in some cases for years) on Tyme and other WOT muds.   Many of 
the posters have coded for Tyme or been a staff member.  Lack of knowledge on 
rp or how Tyme's rp works is not the problem.

Unfortunately (if you are looking for good staff) TMC is not the best place to hunt.  Most of the
regulars are hip-deep in their own coding, building or rp projects and can't find the time
(no pun intended) to take on another.  The 'mud staffing' board is overrun with want ads and 
it is difficult to wade through them.

Tyme is at a disadvantage as Narsil (I am agreeing with Narsil-gawd someone shoot me) and
other have said in that your (in the mud sense) vision is not clear.   Most good staff will not
take on the responcibility with a clear idea of where the mud is going and how they
are expected to fit in to help the vision along.

I realize some of my comments are not timely.  Your post was made in August and I 
can see some changes are already being made.   

I have hated watching Tyme's decline.  Several months ago a friend talked me into considering rping 
here again.  Unfortunately his work schedule increased and I found myself trying to figure
out what was for all purposes a new mud.  Unlike when I began mudding, I simply don't have the time
to spend several hours a day at it.  (my problem, not a mud problem)  

I just wanted to wish you luck in getting things back on track.   (well, okay..I wanted to clarify a bit
on TMC too...(grin)

... What the heck are you talking about?  I never said peple on TMC would not
understand Tyme's RP.

As far as having a clear vision... I'm sorry, this one makes me laugh.
You people go around touting "We need a vision."  I've made it very clear,
countless times, what our goals are, and yet I still get people like you
who complain because there is no 'vision'... What the hell are you talking about?
How many times do I have to state our goals and objectives?  And I realize TMC is

"Heya,
I want to do this so it doesn't sound like I am being rude.  In an August posting
on the proj show board (#12 I think) you mentioned the mudconnector as 
a place where the people would not understand Tyme's rp.   While I respect
your opinion I have to disagree with it.  Several people who post regularly on TMC 
have rped (in some cases for years) on Tyme and other WOT muds.   Many of 
the posters have coded for Tyme or been a staff member.  Lack of knowledge on 
rp or how Tyme's rp works is not the problem."

... What the heck are you talking about?  I never said peple on TMC would not
understand Tyme's RP.

As far as having a clear vision... I'm sorry, this one makes me laugh.
You people go around touting "We need a vision."  I've made it very clear,
countless times, what our goals are, and yet I still get people like you
who complain because there is no 'vision'... What the hell are you talking about?
How many times do I have to state our goals and objectives?  And I realize TMC is
not a good place to look for staff, but it's the best place that exists right
now.  Our goals and objectives have been stated countless times, not only by me,
but by the imps before me.  It doesn't change the fact that w/out coders, they
will never be accomplished.

OKay, lets see if I can do this so it doesnt look weird...

***The only other place to find staff is on sites like mudconnector.  But folks
from there usually have no idea how things work here, no idea about the style
of roleplay.***

(from proj show 12 12)

I am sorry.  I should have been clearer.  My point was many of the people on TMC -have-
immed or played on Tyme in the past.  The problem with TMC is number of good 
people available and getting the message to them, rather than them not being 
qualified.   (in general)

As for being one of the 'you people', I think you have me confused with someone else.
I have never mailed, nor posted about the muds problems to you or to
anyone else.  I only mailed you because I felt your characterization of TMC was 
in error.  

As for the rest, maybe you are tired of hearing 'vision'.  Maybe all the mud needs is imms and
players willing to put a lot of effort into it.  I don't know.  I never claimed to know.  I do know
that this is probably the lowest I have ever seen Tyme.  (and I started playing it over 8 years ago)

And I really hate to mention this but you guys have had some of the best coders.   Do they
burn out?  You say people do not want to imm here.  In the past people wanted to imm here so
badly they would often give up posts on other muds.  It was considered an honor to -get- to
imm here.  If you could find a way to make it feel that way again you would likely 
have all the active staff you need.  Of course, (cough) i have no clue how to do that.  But,
I never said I did.  I am sorry you are frustrated but I am really not the cause of that.
I will refrain from any comments about the mud and perhaps you will not be so annoyed at me.

Thanks again,   -Kat (Layne)

Well, you went linkdead on me so I'll drop you a mail to explain the
details of your guilding :) Firstly, since I mentioned the goldeneyes
in your desc before, I'll clarify that, even though you're guilded
now, you still wouldn't experience any of the yellow eyes changing
or a Wolfkin's special abilities (like enhanced smell) until you have
had some sort of RP involving the wolves talking to you.
You'll also need to ask me next time you see me to get you set up with
the actual goldeneyes talent as well. You'll need to be relevelled
once this is done (is resets your practices from your stats more or
less) because the talent changes your levelling modifier, but it's not
a big deal. There -are- code benifits to being a Wolfkin, and they're
tied in with this talent.

Now, other details. To speak on the wolfkin guild channel you type
'wk text', like you would 'ooc text' or something. There is also a
guild board which you should read (yes, some long posts but you
should be familiar with all of em mostly). To see the guildboard
you can type 'glboard wk show' and to see specific posts you type
'glboard wk show #'. Comments to threads can be seen with
'glboard wk show post# comment#'. It works like the public project
board (proj show). That should get you started at least, and feel
more then free to ask me or another wk any questions you may have.
You can see which Wolfkin (wk) are online by typing 'who -m wk -r'
Have fun :)

-grumble-

Ignore the subject line.

You know, I hate to even ask this since I have had so many arguments with
War Council over the years but I would like to double the size of the Band
maintaining the same proportions. This is to maintain the Banner General ranks
already held by the current guildees and to give the Band more of a punch
for a possible plotline we have in mind.

The original Band at the time of Merone (they grew after that) was,

3k infantry under Dearid (75% pike / 25% archers)
1.5K Cavalry under Talmanes (Light or Heavy not specified)
1.5K Cavalry under Nalesean (Light or Heavy not specified)

I would like to propose another Banner (3K) of Infantry under Rayse. These would
be mostly Tearians, Cairhienins and Andorans much like the cuurent Banner.

I would also like to propose 3K of Shienarans Heavy Cavalry under Aratan and
Tallyn (Talavin) giving them each a Banner of 1.5k each.

My IC explination of them is that they were a force originally of 4K sent south
by Agelmar Jagad to stem the invasion of the Shaido who linked up with Mat and
the Band after the battle of Cairhien. (Jagad fought at the Shining Walls and
didn't want to see that destruction again so he sent this expeditionary force
under two of his most trusted Captains.

`7Subj`6:`7 Things Needed for an Equipment System
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Header One:  Things needed for a suffecient Equipment System -

Coding aspect - Debugg info when Wielding. - Fixed?
Change in code so that AC values can be 1-100, not just 1-20.
Tax and Price Systems based off material composition Values.
Building aspect -
Going through zones 37 and 38, and making stats fit to the WATrialerror.DOC sheet
Creating shop(s) in caemlyn to sell zone 37 and 38 equipment.

- Things that can be gotten around for now, but really ought to be done. -
Make certain weight value is read by the system so that an entered value of 10 is equivelent to 1 pound, not ten pounds
Make the AC value mean a percentage of the sustained damage that is blocked (say hit for 75, you have ac of 10(%), then 7.5 is blocked) instead of how it is currently, (you have ac of 10 and hit for 75, then you're dealt 65 damage)
Check the manner in which Hit Roll is handled.
Balance the equipment.
Make certain that Composition values can be applied to every item, No matter what "Type" flag.
Check to see how well 'range' on items works. (it seems to be slightly screwy right now)

Go through -all- items and set their stats according to current system
Make a different flag for bows than crossbows, and make ranged weapons handle differently than just being a contact weapon with an ungodly range.
Over-haul craft system.

That's about all I can think of for the moment, but there's probably more.
Like I've said here and earlier. Getting equipment in fully is going to be an ungodly task, but getting equipment in partially/suffeciently is very possible.

Best way to do this, is to follow what's under the 1rst header. But there are two other points to consider. First. Give people Tool, and when its completed, Craft.
Second, if you can find a way to make the cost of items be determined in the shops you set up for zone 37/38 equipment, by their composition costs, and all the other shops by their "Value" flag costs, it would make all shops work and sell things at a reasonably appropriate price. (Players getting equipment that does nothing, if its non 37/38 battle eq, isn't an issue, as even if a player has an item created, tooled it, etc. Oediting it will still change its stats.
The third and last piece is an appropriate tax system. Very few people will want to buy equipment with our current tax system on items. It'll make them go broke quickly, make it so they will have to upkeep their charachters, if they want to keep the items (ie, preventing people who check in fairly regularly, but don't get to rp regularly) and generate a general apathy and distaste
For now, Making a timer on equipment that will make it wear out (and have them fix it once its broken (use the old (Broken) flag) or have the items break during combat, is probably a much more desirable format. Also, money should be taxed more heavily than items, and some items should be exempt from taxes (my damnable warder cloak, for instance!) 
I think that's about it, though it probably isn't.

Check the manner in which Hit Roll is handled.
Balance the equipment.
Make certain that Composition values can be applied to every item, No matter what "Type" flag.
Check to see how well 'range' on items works. (it seems to be slightly screwy right now)

Go through -all- items and set their stats according to current system
Make a different flag for bows than crossbows, and make ranged weapons handle differently than just being a contact weapon with an ungodly range.
Over-haul craft system.

That's about all I can think of for the moment, but there's probably more.
Like I've said here and earlier. Getting equipment in fully is going to be an ungodly task, but getting equipment in partially/suffeciently is very possible.

Best way to do this, is to follow what's under the 1rst header. But there are two other points to consider. First. Give people Tool, and when its completed, Craft.
Second, if you can find a way to make the cost of items be determined in the shops you set up for zone 37/38 equipment, by their composition costs, and all the other shops by their "Value" flag costs, it would make all shops work and sell things at a reasonably appropriate price. (Players getting equipment that does nothing, if its non 37/38 battle eq, isn't an issue, as even if a player has an item created, tooled it, etc. Oediting it will still change its stats.
The third and last piece is an appropriate tax system. Very few people will want to buy equipment with our current tax system on items. It'll make them go broke quickly, make it so they will have to upkeep their charachters, if they want to keep the items (ie, preventing people who check in fairly regularly, but don't get to rp regularly) and generate a general apathy and distaste
For now, Making a timer on equipment that will make it wear out (and have them fix it once its broken (use the old (Broken) flag) or have the items break during combat, is probably a much more desirable format. Also, money should be taxed more heavily than items, and some items should be exempt from taxes (my damnable warder cloak, for instance!) 
I think that's about it, though it probably isn't.

Hey. I was working on equip, but I only ever got access to zone
0, so once we had that problem on the bp and zone 0 got
hosed of objects, I haven't been able to edit any objects on the
bp. I had mail out to Cormac, but I haven't heard back from him
in a while.

Anyway, I guess the short answer is yes, technically I am one of
the builders working on equip. I'll send you a tell when I'm
on later. Can't stay now, but I should be back later in the
day after class.

`7Subj`6:`7 Tyranus's background
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Tyranus Degrevaunt was born in Aringill of Andoran and Cairhienin stock. Genetic worked in the man's favor, and his appearance combines the best of both nationalities -- black hair and pale skin, combined with strong Andoran features, hazel eyes, and a stature that hides any Cairhienin blood.
His father, a reasonably well-off merchant, moved the family to Cairhien when Tyranus was just a boy. But the lad always missed Andor and never really settled in Cairhien. Finally, his father shipped him off to live with an uncle in Caemlyn when Tyranus was 14 years old.
Tyranus came into his own then, helping around his uncle's shop and gaining a reputation as a hard worker, if a little on the dull side. He grew up into a large, strong man with very handsome features. At a young age, he decided on the Queen's Guard as his means to advancement. Particularly in the uniform, Tyranus cuts a dashing figure.
Over the years, he has proven a capable soldier and, later a reasonably capable officer. He is as popular with the ladies as ever, and his men find him equally good company -- if in a different manner, of course.
It is Tyranus's superiors who generally find fault with the man. He has a reputation for doing things strictly by the book -- a reputation that leads further to the idea that the man has little imagination. In other words, a fine fellow to call when reinforcements are needed, but not the sort you want attempting to solve a mysterious crime. Behind his back, some oficers occasionally suggest he would have made an excellent Child of the Light.
Of course, there is an upside to that too. He is unswervingly loyal, a good Queen's man, and the men he commands, now that he has risen to the rank of senior file leader, recognize that quality in him and often follow through with loyalty and high morale of their own.
As a result, Tyranus has risen to his current height in the Queen's Guard -- arguably a height that a man of his mediocre capabilities should not have. Still, despite his lack of imagination, he is a skillful soldier, loyal, and brave almost to a fault. For ten years now, he has served the Queen with nary an eyeblink or question -- and therein lies both his strength and his weakness.

--Character Name Avian  
--Email address: niamhbt@earthlink.net
--Physical Description Avian is near six foot tall. Her hair is fire red it hangs low on her back, though she keeps it held back with a dark scarf. Her eyes are a blue sapphire, that sparkle when she's angry, which isn't very often.
--Place of Birth/Raising: Naikai Clan Black Cliffs Sept
--Character History
Avian was born sixteen naming days ago. She never knew her father, for he had went off to fight against the Tree Killers when Lamen sinned. He never returned from the dance. Her mother had been a simple woman, one who had cared for Avian, along with her fellow Sister wife. Avian grew up a happy child, learning about blood feuds, clan wars and lack of water. She rarely fussed or acted out as a child, though most Aiel children don't.
On her fifteenth naming day her mother learned that Avian, was destined to be a wise one. She could channel. This made her mother filled with pride, her not becoming a Maiden. The woman didn't see anything wrong with Maidens, but Avian was the last thing she had on this earth, and despit being Aiel was protective of her only daughter. When the Wise Ones at her Sept had taught her what they could they sent her off to the Wise Ones that guard Rhuidean to be tested. 
When the Car'a'carn came and broke them, the Aiel moved out of Three Fold Land. She followed the Wise One's hoping to finish her lessons. And hopes to go back to Rhiudean one day to become Wise One.

There have been whispers that the union is more political than romantic, these comments fueled, no doubt,
by the age gap between the two.  No date for the wedding has been set as of yet, but it seems that the lady
Coelan is keen to have the wedding sooner, rather than later, as she has already engaged a number of well known

 Hello,
 As requested, here's a slightly more elaborate description of the ability
 that I am applying for.
 As we know, Aginor was the main actor behind the creation of Shadowspawn.
 Trollocs and Myrdraal are the most common shadowspawn that are related to
 humans.  Myrdraal are however not "lesser" SS, but trollocs are.  So the
 Trollocs are the shadowspawn that the requested ability concerns.
 We also know that groups of Trollocs can often be connected (or bonded)
 to a Myrdraal.  The connection is so strong that the death of a Myrdraal
 usually results in the deaths of all trollocs who are connected to that
 Myrdraal.  This connection would be precisely the topic of my study, and
 the ablility that I would gain from the study would allow me to "overtake"
 the ownership of the connection from a Myrdraal, or establish a new one
 if none exists.  In effect, it's about taking the control of arbitrary
 Trollocs, within reasonable limits.  After all, my ability is merely a
 simulation of what a Myrdraal does, so I would be limited to controlling
 at most 3 Trollocs, for example.  Breaking a connection between a Myrdraal
 and his Trollocs would be limited as well - say, at most 2 Trollocs could
 be "overtaken".
 The degree of control is subject to limitations as well.  There would
 always be a limit on how precise the orders could be.  Due to the compulsive
 nature of orders, things like "everyone who wears white must die" would be 
 possible to implant, but "find and kill Joe", or "pick up the spoon" would 
 be impossible.
 The details of how the research would have been conducted can be discussed
 separately.
 Regards,
 Gestahl

Hey sweety. ^_^  Just a quick mudmail before I go for the weekend.

First of all, I remember asking about Jerod & ta'veren, but don't recall
getting a response -- was that when I dropped link?  Prolly. ^_^  Could
I get an update on how that is going?

He requested Rand, btw.  Dunno if I told you that.  Something about not
liking the idea of Rand operating in the background.  I told him so
long as Jerod was against Rand, he couldn't have him cause it would be
a conflict of interest.  Also, there was no remote change of him having
both Rand and a PC ta'veren.  He'd rather have Jerod as a ta'veren. :P

Second bit of nagging.  Apparently the Asha'man sent you an update,
regarding them being equal to the QG or some such?  They asked me to
remind you 'bout that, cause they'd really like to get that RP on the
go.  I have no idea about the circumstances surrounding that situation,
so decided it would be best to just bug ya. :)

Hmmm... finally, I noticed that Matelyna requested Elayne.  If she can
actually be active, I think she'd make a fine Elayne.  I know I am hardly
one to talk :P, but her activity rate has been sporadic of late.  I
am, however, inclined to give her a chance, if both the DD and TT GLs
agree to it.

I think that's about it. ^_^  Hopefully I'll see ya on Monday or Tuesday.
I have a busy weekend of packing ahead of me. *shudders*  I hate moving.

Hugs,
-Bethy

I dunno how much you people talk, so I'll send to you both (Duren, Shai'tan) at once.
Thanks for looking into it for me, Shai - and now you know that she is, D.  There's no
reason to rush, as far as I'm concerned, so even if it takes a week to see any results
at my end, no big deal...  A result would be nice eventually, though. :p

If it's any help, the eq seems to have disappeared after a loss of connection when I
accidently killed my client.

Hey, if you could do a general transfer of the bp to the live port, it'd be good.
The main points (for the asha's sake) though, are the asha'man guild connections,
I can't get onto the bp (as its down atm) so I can't tell you exactly what zones
need transfering over. But if you go to the inner sanctum for the asha'man, and look around, it'll
show you. I think there are three, maybe four .wlds connected with it (.zon as well, I believe)
that need to go over.
The rest of the changes were just typo's around the mud, and fixes to doors and other things
of that sort in caemlyn.
Btw.. Ya'll are slow *Halo* this shits been done since I left.

Howdy. Not sure who's in charge of building at the time being, but
just wanted to let you know that during my winter break, I'll
have some free time to do some building if necessary. I think I
finished editing the armor values last time, so not sure if the
weapons need to be edited as well. Also, I'd like to make a few
changed to the Wisdoms guild area if that's alright. Any other
building projects you know of that I can work on over break, let me
know.

I think my pfile was set with a few building commands on the build
port, or my original mort builder alt is Allec. Not sure which
one you want me to use. I think Allec was set properly, not so
sure about this pfile. So I guess just let me know what you need
done. Also, if someone can give me access to zone 50 (wisdoms guild
area), that would be great.

Thanks.

Area and zones take up the same information. If you want it

It basically just reads the zone names.

Duren did transfer the zone stuff - I was there when he did the

I told him it didn't.

And I remember the sniffer thing, but not the OP sword.  Where'd

I'm not sure how this all will work with the new timeline or such

rewarding that much but the GLs had 4 'slots' for things they could

They weren't specific things, each one was a 'mail the imps and it's

Anyways, no idea what you wanna do with that, it wouldn't really
hurt if they vanished since no-one had one, but obviously even though

On the Matter of Meldorf - since he's already arrested - there's no need

On the matter of Lannes Andronic, as Maty said - he will be tried under

arrested as such, rather cordiall invited (read demanded) to come to a
hearing.
For Alaura Reesad things are a little different - since she's a foreign
noble - or at least Claims to be, since she has nothing with her to back
it up ICly at the moment, as far as I'm aware.

However, since she at least claims to be a noble, I would be wary of 
actually arresting her, since that could cause more of an incident - so I
would go with the same 'cordial invitation' to a hearing.  If you want

As the subject says, thats what I think we should do to gain more

high figure would not be here unless there was a reason.  I have
reason to link that to Lord Hawek, or perhaps some Daes Daemar that
might gain us some good information.  Because Alaura is a noble, I
think I could contact Tarefan again and get a meeting for Alaura
and her.  I believe if we gave her false information about Lord
Hawek or a few other things we can make up, then maybe she will
take that information in exchange for hers.  Though hopefully her
information will be real.  i.e. We have reason to believe Lord
Hawek has links with the Children of the Light, and with gaining
control of the throne he can get a foot hold into the highest of
royalty, gaining even more information for the Whitecloaks.
For all I know, that could be true, but it's something we can make

Taregan.  OK, if you feel like talking about this, reply, best send

The Crow's Nest
ic  Maeldrin (Balcion) takes on the image of a working man as a
disguise.
ic  Balcion (ooc Maeldrin) has a group called Black Lions, they
hire for an unknown reason.  His men disguise themselves
with cloaks and shadows.  They carry many weapons.  Balcion
always tend to take threats to people to get them to join.
He told Lakkam to strongly consider his offer and when he
agrees, to meet him at the Lion's Den and leave word with
the bartender and he will find Lakkam.
ic  Deion asked about Lord Hawek at the table of Simwen (my:retainer), Maeldrin and Lakkam.  Maeldrin (Balcion) replied,
"I have read his proclamations and heard some rumors, but
that is all I care to learn for the moment. Such strife
within a nation promotes business, and as long as he exists,
I shall prosper, as shall my brethren."
ic  Simwen (retainer to Meldorf) spread a made up rumor about
Lord Hawek having connections with Whitecloaks.  This rumor

I'd like to post up some rumors of Lord Hawek and connections with
the Whitecloaks.  With the preivous information I gave you and what
Balcion (Maeldrin) said, this rumor could well be real.  I would
also like to ask whether a rumor needs to be posted on the update

`7Subj`6:`7 Black Lion Division Ranks
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Ebony Claws of the Lion:

Unblooded Claw of the Lion, known as a Pale Claw
Bloodied Claw of the Lion, known as a Crimson Claw
Rending Claw of the Lion, known as a Sunderer (title could be tweaked)
Raking Claw of the Lion, known as a Reaver
Ebony Claw of the Lion, title of one who leads a select 'division'
Ebony Claws of the Lion: Painful Truth, Black Wrath, Looming Noose
Painful Truth are the 'Inquisitors' of the Black Lions, torturing for information
Black Wrath are the extortionists of the Black Lions
Looming Noose are the black-mailers of the Black Lions
Those leading each division bear the title of the division as their own

Crimson Eyes of the Lion:

Blind-Lion of Caemlyn, known as an Untried Eye or the Unseeing
Alley-Eye of Caemlyn, known as a Slinker
Tavern-Eye of Caemlyn, known as a Prowler (not the same as general rank)
Stalking Lion of Caemlyn, known as a Stalker or Night-Hunter
Crimson Eye of the Lion, title of one who leads a select 'division'
Crimson Eyes of the Lion: The Unseen, The Unheard, The Weighted Scales
The Unseen are the smugglers of the Black Lions
The Unheard are the thieves of the Black Lions
The Weighted Scales are the fences of the Black Lions
Those leading each division bear the title of the division as their own

Silent Roar of the Lion:

Quiet Blade, referred to as Reborn
Whispered Struggle, referred to as Initiate
Silent Dispatch, referred to as Assassin
Swift Release, referred to as Death's Scythe
Shadow of Death, referred to as Hand of Death
Master Assassins of the Black Lions: Bloodless End, Brutal Slaughter, Last Breath
Bloodless End deal with accidental appearing deaths
Brutal Slaughter are used for intimidation assassinations
Last Breath are specialty assassinations

All that rule over the entirety of a division: Ebony Claws, Crimson Eyes, Silent Roar
are known as Balcions of 'said division' or just Balcion.

Work needs to be done on some of these, but this is a rough draft of what I
had in mind. Ranks are open to be filled, and there is room for NPCs should such
a need arise.

`7Subj`6:`7 Guild Application
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
`7CC`6: `7Lafargo Lyana Bertram 

Dear Daes Dae'mar GLs,
Thankyou for taking the time to consider my application. Though
I would like to keep my previous record of alts within the guild
confidential I would like to tell you that I have been in and
out of this very guild for six years, however currently I do
not hold any position within the Daes Daemar guild at present
I have held prestigious positions in the past. Below is a copy
of my description and background for your approval. If anything
should cause a descrepencey I would appreicate any help you
could offer to insure it meets your high standards. The speed
in which you would reply affects how soon I can begin seeking
my sponsors so I would appreicate any information as soon as
possible. Thankyou for your time and I look forward to discussing
this further at your convience.

The intricate braided pattern of honey coloured hair gathered beneath
a golden net appears glossy when the light touches it. Her sunkissed
face could belong to any goodwife except the complicated style of the
woman reveals otherwise. Dressed in a rich burgundy dress of Andoran
cut it is evident by the metalic sheen of her belted waist that she
is slender, however there is nothing fragile about this woman. Blinking
blue eyes drink in her surroundings framed by transparent bleached
eyelashes and eyebrows. Her cheeks are unnaturaly touched with a bit
of rouge and the glossy shine of her pink lips also appears unnatural.
Several whisps of hair fall onto her long graceful neck uncaught by
the golden net and intricate braid. Though youth still clings to her
simple features she is no longer a child, but a woman who could have
already celebrated her 30th nameday. 

Makenna Trakand is the youngest and only daughter of the prestigious
Willard and Tarasita Trakand. With 7 older brothers she was a favorite
of her fathers and still adored by her brothers, her mother, who she
bares striking respeblence to fell sickly shortly after her birth and
did not survive her daughters first year of life. Without a mother and
with a royal bloodline aswell abundant wealth she was induldge even as
a young child. She adored arts, fashion even then and was a prize pupil
of her tutors. She was introduced to Penelope Avery at the age of six.
Penelope was the daughter of a minor Andoran House hold, however the
two girls became instant friends. When Makenna came into her 25th year
studying was simply not enough for her any longer. She desired to see
all that she had learned about for herself. Asking Penolope to accompany
her was an honor the unimportant house of Avery could not pass up and
so with her friend and a small accompany of men her father has specificaly
chosen she set out to discover the world. Her adventures took her
from place to place, funded by her father of course untill the tragic
news of her fathers sudden passing brought an overwhelming grief and
sense of guilt to Makenna. Instead of returning home to her brothers and
the 'wives' as she called her seven sister-in-laws who disapproved of
Makenna's freedom to roam the world or were rather envious of it she
returned instead to Andor, taking up residence in the Royal Palace with
her fathers youngest and widowed four times sister. Her brothers approved
of her sudden desire to settle down hoping she will at long last find
a suitable husband on her own, none of them wanting to saddle their
beloved little sister with a planned marriage and unwanted husband. Her
oldest brother Wilfred now in his 54th year tends to her funds and
property of the lands origionaly her mothers before wedding her father
that was left to her. Also Wilfred manages the substantial dowery of
another considerable property that will become hers and her husbands
upon marriage. Makenna has seen neither and seems to care little, holding
her propority very dear and never seen in the presence of a man without
her trusted Penelope. Those who like her would say Makenna is witty,
charming and educated. Those that do not would see her as a gossip,
a fake or perhaps self rightous. She is a woman accustomed to getting
her way using compliments or information as she sees fit, however her
generosity to a begger on the street or kindness toward an orphaned
child has won the hearts of those common and royal alike.

The intricate braided pattern of honey coloured hair gathered beneath
a golden net appears glossy when the light touches it. Her sunkissed
face could belong to any goodwife except the complicated style of the
woman reveals otherwise. Dressed in a rich burgundy dress of Andoran
cut it is evident by the metalic sheen of her belted waist that she
is slender, however there is nothing fragile about this woman. Blinking
blue eyes drink in her surroundings framed by transparent bleached
eyelashes and eyebrows. Her cheeks are unnaturaly touched with a bit
of rouge and the glossy shine of her pink lips also appears unnatural.
Several whisps of hair fall onto her long graceful neck uncaught by
the golden net and intricate braid. Though youth still clings to her
simple features she is no longer a child, but a woman who could have
already celebrated her 30th nameday. 

Makenna Trakand is the youngest and only daughter of the prestigious
Willard and Tarasita Trakand. With 7 older brothers she was a favorite
of her fathers and still adored by her brothers, her mother, who she
bares striking respeblence to fell sickly shortly after her birth and
did not survive her daughters first year of life. Without a mother and
with a royal bloodline aswell abundant wealth she was induldge even as
a young child. She adored arts, fashion even then and was a prize pupil
of her tutors. She was introduced to Penelope Avery at the age of six.
Penelope was the daughter of a minor Andoran House hold, however the
two girls became instant friends. When Makenna came into her 25th year
studying was simply not enough for her any longer. She desired to see
all that she had learned about for herself. Asking Penolope to accompany
her was an honor the unimportant house of Avery could not pass up and
so with her friend and a small accompany of men her father has specificaly
chosen she set out to discover the world. Her adventures took her
from place to place, funded by her father of course untill the tragic
news of her fathers sudden passing brought an overwhelming grief and
sense of guilt to Makenna. Instead of returning home to her brothers and
the 'wives' as she called her seven sister-in-laws who disapproved of
Makenna's freedom to roam the world or were rather envious of it she
returned instead to Andor, taking up residence in the Royal Palace with
her fathers youngest and widowed four times sister. Her brothers approved
of her sudden desire to settle down hoping she will at long last find
a suitable husband on her own, none of them wanting to saddle their
beloved little sister with a planned marriage and unwanted husband. Her
oldest brother Wilfred now in his 54th year tends to her funds and
property of the lands origionaly her mothers before wedding her father
that was left to her. Also Wilfred manages the substantial dowery of
another considerable property that will become hers and her husbands
upon marriage. Makenna has seen neither and seems to care little, holding
her propority very dear and never seen in the presence of a man without
her trusted Penelope. Those who like her would say Makenna is witty,
charming and educated. Those that do not would see her as a gossip,
a fake or perhaps self rightous. She is a woman accustomed to getting
her way using compliments or information as she sees fit, however her
generosity to a begger on the street or kindness toward an orphaned
child has won the hearts of those common and royal alike.

Special Authorization Request: Three piece mail, most likely spliced
into several due to the length. My apologies from the beginning. The first
piece deals with Deruthias' current background, and bears no real connection
to the past I shall be submitting. In essence, each piece shows a greater
depth into his History, thus easily removed from his background should they
not be found worth authorizing.

Present Situation Regarding Deruthias:

Deruthias was born late in the year 978, his parents near the age is he
now. Both his grandparents and great-grandparents remain alive, though
they have become separated by distance: each living in a different
village. This follows the tradition of their free lands: When a woman
marries, their family pays a dowry to the man's family: in turn, the
husband moves to his wife's village. Material items are traded, slightly
weakening the village: in return the village gains a new worker, someone
to aid in bringing 'wealth' to the village. So it came that Deruthias
Everin was born in a nameless village near to the Black Hills, his home
set between the Rivers Ivo and Haevin. There were three choices to those
living within the village: mining, farming, or herding. The Everin family
chose sheep, and as such, lived upon the western fringes of the village,
their own small home perched upon the first of many levels upon a rather
large, wooded hill. It was an ideal location: the area open for the sheep,
the forest nearby for firewood and rough lumber, and a beautiful view
of the village. Though the Black Hills rose higher to the east than their
lesser brethren to the west, Deruthias' home stood at least 500 feet over
the town and a mile away. It was a relaxing home, and Deruthias was raised
in a calm environment. The people of the Caralain and Black Hills, while
a touch rough with outsiders, when they did come through, they were polite
and respectful toward each other. There was no need for violence, or even
verbal floggings: instead, each festival (thrice a year all the local
villages gathered at alternating locations) they would hold 'competitions'
for wit. It was here that polite quips and slander were exchanged, all in
good humor. It was through this tradition that Deruthias learned his quick
wit, his humor, and his pleasant demeanor. The child grew up slowly, time
seeming less important here than in most parts of the lands: the reason
Deruthias seems unhurried with life, seeming to prefer a more relaxed
pace for all things in life. So it went that Deruthias was raised, a few
lessons in horsemanship here and there when neighboring villagers would
visit to barter for some Everin mutton or wool. Though Deruthias' mother
was nowhere near the best or most creative of the weavers, she did good
solid work. At the age of 9, Deruthias' (or Thias as he is more often titled),
father bartered with one such horse-rancher for a mare and a colt that
was almost of age. It was then that Deruthias was taught how to ride (nothing
fancy or worth a rock in battle) and subsequently put to work as a courier
for his village. It was his own service, as his family had the only horse
in town that wasn't used for carting the resources mined to the east to
town. This became a routine for him, once a month he would ride between the
villages delivering messages as well as collecting them for his return home.
Even with all the written word he dealt with, Deruthias never learned to
read or write. His vocal ability, like so many from the area, seemed all
that was needed in such a relaxed village. The child had an imagination
though, or perhaps a sight of the past: images of great battles with other
men, the Shadow, anything that could be drawn into existance with his
thoughts ran rampent through Deruthias' mind. When not running messages,
Deruthias would stand watch over his father's herd: often this led to the
youth making his way into the nearby forest to roam idling along the fringes.
Wolves were known to wander the forest, but none were ever seen by the Everin
boy, though he did sight a man time and again over the years. He never spoke
with him, but often they would share a connection, eyes meeting and held for
moments that lingered into hours. Always curious, yet seeming unwilling to
spark a conversation, Deruthias often redirected his thoughts concerning the
silent meetings. They remain, though, rising to take his attention every few
months if not years. The ethereal tradition between Deruthias and the forest-
lord (as Thias came to regard him) dwindled as the Everin boy grew older,
coming into adulthood. He life was sedate, a tranquil passage of time: a

wit, his humor, and his pleasant demeanor. The child grew up slowly, time
seeming less important here than in most parts of the lands: the reason
Deruthias seems unhurried with life, seeming to prefer a more relaxed
pace for all things in life. So it went that Deruthias was raised, a few
lessons in horsemanship here and there when neighboring villagers would
visit to barter for some Everin mutton or wool. Though Deruthias' mother
was nowhere near the best or most creative of the weavers, she did good
solid work. At the age of 9, Deruthias' (or Thias as he is more often titled),
father bartered with one such horse-rancher for a mare and a colt that
was almost of age. It was then that Deruthias was taught how to ride (nothing
fancy or worth a rock in battle) and subsequently put to work as a courier
for his village. It was his own service, as his family had the only horse
in town that wasn't used for carting the resources mined to the east to
town. This became a routine for him, once a month he would ride between the
villages delivering messages as well as collecting them for his return home.
Even with all the written word he dealt with, Deruthias never learned to
read or write. His vocal ability, like so many from the area, seemed all
that was needed in such a relaxed village. The child had an imagination
though, or perhaps a sight of the past: images of great battles with other
men, the Shadow, anything that could be drawn into existance with his
thoughts ran rampent through Deruthias' mind. When not running messages,
Deruthias would stand watch over his father's herd: often this led to the

spark a conversation, Deruthias often redirected his thoughts concerning the
silent meetings. They remain, though, rising to take his attention every few
months if not years. The ethereal tradition between Deruthias and the forest-

Special Authorization Request: Three piece mail, most likely spliced
into several due to the length. My apologies from the beginning. The first
piece deals with Deruthias' current background, and bears no real connection
to the past I shall be submitting. In essence, each piece shows a greater
depth into his History, thus easily removed from his background should they
not be found worth authorizing.

Present Situation Regarding Deruthias:

Deruthias was born late in the year 978, his parents near the age is he
now. Both his grandparents and great-grandparents remain alive, though
they have become separated by distance: each living in a different
village. This follows the tradition of their free lands: When a woman
marries, their family pays a dowry to the man's family: in turn, the
husband moves to his wife's village. Material items are traded, slightly
weakening the village: in return the village gains a new worker, someone
to aid in bringing 'wealth' to the village. So it came that Deruthias
Everin was born in a nameless village near to the Black Hills, his home
set between the Rivers Ivo and Haevin. There were three choices to those
living within the village: mining, farming, or herding. The Everin family
chose sheep, and as such, lived upon the western fringes of the village,
their own small home perched upon the first of many levels upon a rather
large, wooded hill. It was an ideal location: the area open for the sheep,
the forest nearby for firewood and rough lumber, and a beautiful view
of the village. Though the Black Hills rose higher to the east than their
lesser brethren to the west, Deruthias' home stood at least 500 feet over
the town and a mile away. It was a relaxing home, and Deruthias was raised
in a calm environment. The people of the Caralain and Black Hills, while
a touch rough with outsiders, when they did come through, they were polite
and respectful toward each other. There was no need for violence, or even
verbal floggings: instead, each festival (thrice a year all the local
villages gathered at alternating locations) they would hold 'competitions'
for wit. It was here that polite quips and slander were exchanged, all in
good humor. It was through this tradition that Deruthias learned his quick

rode with the other three young men, each insulting the other in good humor,
and telling stories of their lives. This lasted only a fortnight, as Deruthias
overslept one morning and awoke (possessions untouched - theft between those
of the caralain was unheard of but for the rarest of cases), Deruthias started
out on his own seeking to catch up with his lost companions. He did not follow
the same course as they, and as such, spent three fortnights traveling alone,
undisturbed. He just recently arrived upon the road leading north to Tar Valon,
and will be there in short time even with a slow pace.

OOC Note: I am going to be sending this to DD (authorization of ancient nobility,
WK (for the Forest-Lord, as I would like to have him be an WK NPC, thus I seek
their approval), Nicodemus (to authorize the case and contents), and the Shadow
as it will come into play within the Family History I intend to craft and submit.
If authorization does not come, then the case is ebony wood with simple steel
hinges and lock and contains nothing within it: the Forest-Lord but a strange
man wandering the woods with no connection to the Wolves: and Deruthias' family
not bearing a touch of ancient noble blood. ICly he knows nothing of the Shadow
and his Family History with it, so that will not come into play until the role-
play has been fleshed out down the road if indeed the connection is authorized.

Last Years of House Everin:

512 NE is the year, the final tremors from the fall of Caralain
having rippled across the Grass. The rolling plains of the river
valley (between the Ivo and Arienelle) near to the forests that
claimed the lands between the Mountains of Mist and Arienelle.
A mixture between rugged forested hills and rolling, cultivated
plains, the parcel of land was ruled over by House Everin. Nearer
the rugged forests than the cultivated farmlands, the center of
the House of Everin rose to the side of a town ringed by isolated
villages: their fortified manor (appearing a castle to those that
called the 'frontier' home), watched over the town from a recessed
circle upon the hill. Three sides the hill stretched around the
manorhouse: seeming to paint the picture that it was both a part of
the town whilst appearing apart from the village. The eldest of
House Everin had dwelled in the manorhouse generation after
generation, seventh in line of succession and sharing blood with
the now deposed King. It was here that the last three of House
Everin ended their old lives and set out to begin new ones.
Lord and Lady Everin were preparing their departure from the manor,
servants milling through the dwelling as the men-at-arms of House
Everin were holding a tense vigil. The populace was beginning to
rise against the final remnants of nobility, most having fled to
family in other realms, many not surviving the journey. Something
had stirred the populace under the protection of House Everin,
a Friend of the Dark sent to incite riots within the crumbling
realm. It had been more powerful here, as for years beyond count
the family had set itself to rooting out Darkfriends and foiling
their plans. They sought to protect all against the manipulations of
the Dark One's minions, going to great lengths to set fire to their
webs of deception. The House of Everin slowly dwindled over decades,
the Shadow actively seeking to wipe out those of the blood of
Everin. It came to pass that they almost succeeded in 512 NE, the
Lord and Lady - with their 3 year old son and entourage of servants-
into the night. The villagers their keep watched over filled the
streets of the village, their angry forms barring exit from the town.
Lord Stefhen Everin ordered his men to do them no harm, but part the
crowd so they might pass. The guards complied, the villagers seeming
to obey as the Lord and his family departed: a voice rose through the
crowd, a hiss of anger and wrath, inciting the populace into a riotous
mass. The Lord fled with his family, the soldiers of House Everin
attempting to withdraw from the battle. Blood was spilled, and many
of the soldiers were taken to the ground, a handful all that was able
to free themselves from the frenzied mass. Eight soldiers followed
after the Lord Everin, days turning into weeks as the mounted company
traveled east across the rolling plains. They neared the Black Hills

valley (between the Ivo and Arienelle) near to the forests that
claimed the lands between the Mountains of Mist and Arienelle.
A mixture between rugged forested hills and rolling, cultivated
plains, the parcel of land was ruled over by House Everin. Nearer
the rugged forests than the cultivated farmlands, the center of
the House of Everin rose to the side of a town ringed by isolated
villages: their fortified manor (appearing a castle to those that
called the 'frontier' home), watched over the town from a recessed
circle upon the hill. Three sides the hill stretched around the
manorhouse: seeming to paint the picture that it was both a part of
the town whilst appearing apart from the village. The eldest of
House Everin had dwelled in the manorhouse generation after
generation, seventh in line of succession and sharing blood with
the now deposed King. It was here that the last three of House
Everin ended their old lives and set out to begin new ones.
Lord and Lady Everin were preparing their departure from the manor,
servants milling through the dwelling as the men-at-arms of House
Everin were holding a tense vigil. The populace was beginning to
rise against the final remnants of nobility, most having fled to
family in other realms, many not surviving the journey. Something
had stirred the populace under the protection of House Everin,
a Friend of the Dark sent to incite riots within the crumbling
realm. It had been more powerful here, as for years beyond count
the family had set itself to rooting out Darkfriends and foiling
their plans. They sought to protect all against the manipulations of
the Dark One's minions, going to great lengths to set fire to their
webs of deception. The House of Everin slowly dwindled over decades,
the Shadow actively seeking to wipe out those of the blood of
Everin. It came to pass that they almost succeeded in 512 NE, the
Lord and Lady - with their 3 year old son and entourage of servants-
into the night. The villagers their keep watched over filled the
streets of the village, their angry forms barring exit from the town.
Lord Stefhen Everin ordered his men to do them no harm, but part the
crowd so they might pass. The guards complied, the villagers seeming
to obey as the Lord and his family departed: a voice rose through the
crowd, a hiss of anger and wrath, inciting the populace into a riotous
mass. The Lord fled with his family, the soldiers of House Everin
attempting to withdraw from the battle. Blood was spilled, and many
of the soldiers were taken to the ground, a handful all that was able

overslept one morning and awoke (possessions untouched - theft between those
of the caralain was unheard of but for the rarest of cases), Deruthias started
out on his own seeking to catch up with his lost companions. He did not follow
the same course as they, and as such, spent three fortnights traveling alone,
undisturbed. He just recently arrived upon the road leading north to Tar Valon,
and will be there in short time even with a slow pace.

their approval), Nicodemus (to authorize the case and contents), and the Shadow
as it will come into play within the Family History I intend to craft and submit.
If authorization does not come, then the case is ebony wood with simple steel
hinges and lock and contains nothing within it: the Forest-Lord but a strange
man wandering the woods with no connection to the Wolves: and Deruthias' family
not bearing a touch of ancient noble blood. ICly he knows nothing of the Shadow

however, work, but don't work properly (weaves to change

The Skills that would be good to have back, and given at 
something above 25% (which the majority of our skills are 
currently limited to) Direct Combat skills have been nixed 
from the list, as well as a few other things that would simply 
cause problems in our current system. What remains are the 
skills (although some have disappeared and some would be 
useless) that'd it'd be good to be able to use, and good to be 
able to point to on a skill sheet.

however, work, but don't work properly (weaves to change 
stats, for instance, say they affect them, but don't affect you 
under the new system) All spells that would cause problems

`7Subj`6:`7 Variety of Matters
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
`7CC`6: `7Lafargo Lyana Bertram 

Firstly: My apologies for the lack of role-play I have been
maintaining. Several affairs have been piled upon my plate, and
I am working on quite a few threads currently. I intend to remedy
the situation as soon as possible.

Secondly: Regards to Maeldrin and his role-play. Maeldrin is using
the alias 'Ceril Laucion', as Ceril was the name of eldest son of the
House of Laucion that was exterminated. There is the youngest son of
the House currently alive and in possession of the truth. I have worked
out a listing of House Laucion, but have as of yet to offer first names
to all involved. In essence, the structure of the House places Maeldrin,
as Ceril Laucion, heir to his immediate House - an actual Lord rather than
simply a Noble - and thirteenth in line of succession for High Seat of
House Laucion of Murandy. I would prefer to role-play the rising to Lord of
House Laucion in the wake of /his father's death/. The family is not on the
greatest of speaking terms, and visits between occur only once every few years,
as each is preoccupied with finding a way to raise House Laucion onto a higher
tier, and perhaps wrench control from the current High Seat by such actions,
meaning that Maeldrin (it helps he is a Theatre Supplier - though he looks
the part of Ceril Laucion without any additions of wigs/powders/etc.) could
easily pose as his alias, and be titled Lord of House Laucion, and actually
set himself in line for High Seat. With his merchant dealings, as well his
lack of morality concerning the 'removal' of obstacles, he could rise to the
position of High Seat, and perhaps bring House Laucion to a higher tier within
Murandian nobility.

Thirdly: The situation concerning Jayl as a captive of the Queen's Guard. Mael
have taken a personal interest in this matter, as he ICly cares little for the
Asha'man, and as such, will do what he may to spoil their plans for Jayl Elehar's
demise. I have spoken to you, as well as Jerod (Medaku having been idle more often
than naught) concerning the matter of an escape attempt, or even freeing Jayl
while being transported. With an in-prison hanging, that would leave the first
open to role-play. My intentions, with IC connections as a Theatre Supplier, are
to have tailored uniforms so that a few thieves may enter the prison, get the proper
keys and try to bluff the guards (or knock them out if such seems wiser at the
time) while stealing Jayl away to freedom. However such would work out, I would
like to get something concrete set up, unless you have already executed Jayl, and if
that is the case, I apologize for bringing this up.

Lastly: The Black Lions of Andor (Thieves Guild) are growing a touch, and hopefully
will continue to do so. I posted on my own trying to elicit at least one response,
and Lyana had suggested some role-play concerning Thieves outside of Andor. I have
heard nothing regarding anything as of yet, and would like your help - or at least
authorization to have a Guild Immortal run Quests regarding this matter - to set up
the role-play and get this rolling. The entirety of the Thieves Guild are great role-
players, and I think we should try our best to get them some 'action', as it /will/
benefit all guilds around OOCly, though it may draw some IC hostility.

Secondly: Regards to Maeldrin and his role-play. Maeldrin is using
the alias 'Ceril Laucion', as Ceril was the name of eldest son of the
House of Laucion that was exterminated. There is the youngest son of
the House currently alive and in possession of the truth. I have worked
out a listing of House Laucion, but have as of yet to offer first names
to all involved. In essence, the structure of the House places Maeldrin,
as Ceril Laucion, heir to his immediate House - an actual Lord rather than
simply a Noble - and thirteenth in line of succession for High Seat of
House Laucion of Murandy. I would prefer to role-play the rising to Lord of
House Laucion in the wake of /his father's death/. The family is not on the
greatest of speaking terms, and visits between occur only once every few years,
as each is preoccupied with finding a way to raise House Laucion onto a higher
tier, and perhaps wrench control from the current High Seat by such actions,
meaning that Maeldrin (it helps he is a Theatre Supplier - though he looks
the part of Ceril Laucion without any additions of wigs/powders/etc.) could
easily pose as his alias, and be titled Lord of House Laucion, and actually
set himself in line for High Seat. With his merchant dealings, as well his
lack of morality concerning the 'removal' of obstacles, he could rise to the
position of High Seat, and perhaps bring House Laucion to a higher tier within
Murandian nobility.

Thirdly: The situation concerning Jayl as a captive of the Queen's Guard. Mael
have taken a personal interest in this matter, as he ICly cares little for the
Asha'man, and as such, will do what he may to spoil their plans for Jayl Elehar's
demise. I have spoken to you, as well as Jerod (Medaku having been idle more often
than naught) concerning the matter of an escape attempt, or even freeing Jayl
while being transported. With an in-prison hanging, that would leave the first
open to role-play. My intentions, with IC connections as a Theatre Supplier, are
to have tailored uniforms so that a few thieves may enter the prison, get the proper
keys and try to bluff the guards (or knock them out if such seems wiser at the
time) while stealing Jayl away to freedom. However such would work out, I would
like to get something concrete set up, unless you have already executed Jayl, and if
that is the case, I apologize for bringing this up.

Lastly: The Black Lions of Andor (Thieves Guild) are growing a touch, and hopefully
will continue to do so. I posted on my own trying to elicit at least one response,
and Lyana had suggested some role-play concerning Thieves outside of Andor. I have
heard nothing regarding anything as of yet, and would like your help - or at least
authorization to have a Guild Immortal run Quests regarding this matter - to set up
the role-play and get this rolling. The entirety of the Thieves Guild are great role-
players, and I think we should try our best to get them some 'action', as it /will/
benefit all guilds around OOCly, though it may draw some IC hostility.

Maeldrin. GL of the CotL. Liason to the Thieves Guild. Amadician Lord gone Murandian.

i2 <184/184hp 204/204mv 13893tnl>  
Letting her take the teacup from his hands, Jerod shrugs faintly at her question, "Very well, under the circumstances.."  He grins slightly, his eyes upon her softly as she sips her tea, "It brought back some memories, and those felt strange.. from another time, Im sure you understand..."  He falls into silence as the door to his chamber opens and closes, admitting not one of his servants, but a stranger alltogether.  A moment later, his emotions are but a distant thought, the firey power of Saidin flowing into his body, along with the stomach-wenching taste of the taint.  As Saidin fills him, flows of air reach out, ropes dancing with a mind of their own to wrap and entangle the stranger, binding him tightly.  [Jerod]
i2 <184/184hp 204/204mv 13893tnl>  
[GI] Nicodemus's [Grouch] Beonca : Eirik I've been requested to ask that you leave that room for now.

`7Subj`6:`7 Sachi's Background
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
`7CC`6: `7Yoshida Klentira 


Born the second child in a large family of five kids, Sachi and her family owned a small but tidy inn on the eastern side in the port city of Noren M'Shar.  Though it wasnt exactly the life of a Blood, it was by no means an uncomfortable existance for the first twelve years of her life.  She, and the other children, learned the family business at a fairly young age and were expected to help out around the place to keep the costs of paying out for help down.

Unfortunately for Sachi, she never felt like she belonged in their family.  All her siblings and her parents were dark haired with olive complexions, their bodies tending to be on the heavier side.  Sachi was born with white blonde hair that eventually faded into a golden honey color.  It caused quite a bit of teasing from her siblings and from other children that lived nearby.

It was around the same night of a Feastday being held in the honor of  a sul'dam coming to test the young girls around the area, that Sachi found out the truth about her heritage and why it was that her father never really paid her all that much attention.  It was a few months before her twelfth birthday that the celebration was to be held, the inn was prepared for the festivities as well as a large number of guests who might be staying over.  For some reason, the Imperial Sul'dam also picked the Bakuun's inn to stay in as well for the celebration.

The activities were just starting to get on their way when Sachi accidently dropped a plate on the floor while washing dishes in the kitchen.  Her father, who happened to be standing behind her at the time, was angered and backhanded the girl against the back of the head.  It caused an argument to start between her parents, much to the mortification of the guests who could hear in the common room and to the other children in the family

After a few moments of red-faced screaming, her father blurted out that Sachi wasn't really his child anyway and that she had been an embarassment on the family name.  The Sul'dam came into the room to break up the argument and then gently pulled young Sachi into the private dining room so that they could have a talk.  She tried to explain that sometimes people said things when angry that weren't exactly true, but the damage was already done to the poor girl.  In an effort to try and cheer her up, the Sul'dam allowed Sachi to wear the silver bracelet that had been connected to her own wrist.

To everyone's disbelief and relief, Sachi could actually feel the woman on the other side of the silvery leash.  This changed everything for their family, atleast in the way that they looked at the young girl.  Her things were packed that night and she travelled back to Seandar so that she could be trained.  Her mother came into her room that night, while she was packing, and explained to Sachi that she had been attacked twelve years before by some men on the outskirts of town while getting some supplies for the Inn.  It was in that attack that Sachi had been concieved though the family had tried to convince themselves otherwise.  It saddened and answered a lot of questions for the young girl, as well as brought her some relief before she was sent off.

***special note***

I left the end of the background open but could include where she might have gotten some training for being a Sul'dam.  Let me know if there needs to be any changes made.

Well, I've been in and out of sleep/afk for the last two hours,
and you seemed to have lost link and don't appear to be coming
back tonight, which might be a good thing if you say you have
to be up earlier in the morning tomorrow. I guess I will see you
tomorrow evening, then, at around 1-2 am EST, yes? If this is
not so, drop me a line (either mudmail or email) to let me know
about it so I don't stay up. Eww, tomorrow's Valentine's Day,

One can't help but notice that this man is tall, easily breaking six feet by 
another hand or so. A pair of eyes of a pale green are slightly sunken and 
give him an intense look even when his face is neutral. All along his jawline 
is a blonde covering that makes up a beard that is worn forked. Each fork is 
about eight inches in length and an inch from where it starts has a band of 
silver to hold it. Bright blonde hair is worn long, most of it tied in back 
with a single leather cord. The only distinction on his head is a single 
weaving scar that runs from the front of his hairline to the back of his 
cranium. Fair skinned and gangly the young man, perhaps just twenty summers, 
has a whispy look to him that even graces his flowing movement. The only other 
visable marks on his body a criss-crossed scar that rests, much darker than 
his skin tone, on his left forearm near the elbow.

Adorning his left ear is a single stud earring made of fine silver. A very dark 
red shirt that almost seems of a muted tone is tucked loosely into a pair of 
black riding breeches that seem to hug his long, muscular legs. The top of the 
shirt always seems to be undone to reveal a wirey build of lean muscle. The 
breeches are tucked into a tall pair of worn riding boots of a earth brown tone 
with silver spurs. Over his shirt is an unbuttoned coat of black that has three 
precious silver chains looped across his chest. Worn about his waist is a 
double-belt that seems a little thinner than normal made of well-used leather. 
The belts are worn snuggly and seem to make the rest of his clothes follow his 
body when he moves. Visablely worn like a third belt, and connected at the right 
hip to his doubled one, is a heavy swordbelt connecting to the sheathe of a 
hand-and-a-half sword. The sheathe is plain black leather banded with silver 
inlay. Sewn into the center of his sheathe is a large stag made of a dark red 
thread.

I am hoping to play a darkfriend.  My background has been approved by shai'tan.  I need my retainer not to tell who it is the retainer of.  (it says Rionn's retainer.)  This means that if I send my retainer off to do evil things, people will know ooc'ly that Rionn hired that retainer and this will affect actions towards Rionn IC.  Everyone will know ooc'ly that Rionn is a darkfriend and this is no good.  The retainer and Rionn need to have no links between each other, either IC'ly or oocl'y.  Could you take off the 'Rionn's' bit in Rionn's retainer in his title?  
I can imagine why this could not be allowed.  Because people need to know the situation before a battle.  they would need to know if me and my retainer were both emoting in the same room so they know who to fight but this does not really matter because if I were going to fight with both, I would either tell them he is my retainer or pretend he is just a friend who feels like helping me and that me and the retainer had never met before.  I see no real reason why you can't take the relating name off the title of the retainer.  It is not unfair to anyone and more realistic.  I am sure Shai'tan wants me to remain annonymous ooc'ly as well as IC'ly and so do I or its no fun, and unrealistic.  Please get back to me as soon as you can with your decision. Thank you.

Hi there,

No, I'm not an old player here, and no, I've never staffed on Tyme. However,
I'd like to offer any help and support that I can give for the proposed six-
person project idea. I have some experience running RP plots on other MU*s,
and while I'm new to Tyme, I'm very familiar with both the Wheel of Time
setting and WoT RP MU*s. Let me know if there's anything I can do - although
I'll probably be more use in descing temporary locations and troubleshooting/
picking holes in plot ideas than as a part of the main task force.

Cheers,

Chak's player

PS. I'll be slightly inactive until Monday, due to my being in France and
my broadband connection being in England, but after that I'm yours.

PS. I'll be slightly inactive until Monday, due to my being in France and
my broadband connection being in England, but after that I'm yours.

`7From`6:`7 Jhevon
`7Subj`6:`7 Background for Asha
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Jhevon was born in Andor, to a rather poor family who lived on the outskirts
of Caemlyn.  His father worked as a blacksmith until he got his hand stepped
on by a horse he was shoeing, injuring his hand to the point he could no
longer hold the tools needed for his craft.  His mother works at a seamstress
shop, but doesn't make enough money to feed her large family.  Jhevon is
the oldest child of eight... with five brothers and two sisters.  His sisters
are aged 5 and 10 respectively, and even though they are learning to sew like
their mother, they are too young to be of much use.  His brothers, aged 1, 3,
6, 8, and 12 respectively, are also too young to support the family, although
the two older ones, Jasen and Jhaele, have become apprentice blacksmiths.

Jhevon, being light of build, was never really cut out to be a blacksmith, and
had dreams as a child of being the Captain-General of the Queen's Guard.  He
is now 15.  Though he no longer has delusions of grandeur about being a highly
ranked officer in the Guard, he realizes that with his father's recent injury,
he needs to find a way to support his family, and soon.  He is currently in
the city, looking for work so he can at least support himself, even if he
cannot support the rest of his family.  His father, though injured, is still
cannot support the rest of his family.  His father, though injured, does what
he can to help his wife in her sewing business.  Jhevon's family will not go
hungry, even if he does not find a job, but yet he still feels the need to at
least not be a burden.

Jhevon does have the ability to channel, though he does not know it yet.  With
the prominence of the Asha'man in Caemlyn, and their role as law enforcement, he
has become interested in them, and is willing to submit to the tests to see if
he can become one of them.

If you need further information, please let me know.

Crunching the numbers on these now, just letting you know that I'll
do the Weapons while I'm at it, most of them just need either the

it will mostly be checking and confirming. Unfortunately I apparently
can't look at putting any of them in yet as, when I tried today to

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Dear Beonca,
     How are you. I am making my offical request to place my interest
in the Aiel Guildleader position. To tell you a little bit about my
past here on Moments in Tyme. I have been with the mud since it opened
in various forms. In the days of Mikki and Dini I played Pheodora
the DD GL, as well as Selina the Illuminator GL. Then moved to becoming
Shaidar to help the Shai'tan at the time handle Dreadlords and I also
played Semirhage to help with the roleplay at that time. I then got
accepted into college and had to leave my postions to focus on that,
while I played Narissa a Brown Ajah, and the bookie Verin when I was
not studying while Kane had taken over. When I was on spring break
and weekends, I became Matthias (shoots her typist) helper taking
requests, complaints, reports from the imms and send him weekly
reports for him to be kept well informed and less spammed in mail.
I then took a leave of absence from mudding killing off Narissa, and
given up Verin when bookies were taken out. I have returned about
4 months now back to the mud, with Calina the Blue whom was killed by
a Red Sister because she was a rebel. I then renamed as Genevra to
keep up with rp, just taking Trelsendra to help encourage the Ogier
roleplay. I have/had in the past expressed an interest in the Aiel
however gave up those interest because the GL and I could not hook up
or discuss character concepts. Now that the postion is open, I think
a largely needed presence of the Aiel are need because it is an
important guild for the theme of the books, and the roleplay of the
timeline we have here.

What kind of plans would I have for the guild? One...ROLEPLAY! I would
deguild Genevra, rename her and make her a channeling Wise One who
can dreamwalk so I can help with roleplaying for those Wise One's who
one are channelers, and two for those who are dreamwalkers who need
training. Two, I would then review the current ranks within the guild
and research them to the books to make sure they are as exact as they
can be...three, I would then speak with Rand and Jerod on possible
inter-guild relations being we have an active Rand for Maidens, WO and
Spears to roleplay and back up. Four, speak with Jerod about possible
relations and plots that we could run as guilds that would be linked
to Rand since we are the two guilds that need to be linked to him the
closest. Finally, be online as a presence to show the mud they have
someone who will help answer their questions, show them structure,
and be a leader they need for them to ensure the Aiel have roleplay as
well as someone to work with the imms on plots, events, and overall
gaining a better name that they Aiel need.

I guess in the end what I feels will make me qualified as the Aiel
GL is my experience, my passion to get it off the ground like I have
done my guilds in the past, and give me something to do when I am home
then watch TV and burn my brain cells there. I can burn my brain cells
doing something that will improve the environment of the game.

If you have any questions please feel free to speak to me as Genevra or
Trelsendra or email me at Graendal2004@aol.com

Sorry that I couldn't stay up but it's about quarter to 1am my time and I'm just beat.  Gavin came home with three stitches.  They said it was pretty deep but the wound was narrow enough to not need inside stitche.  No concussion either, which is good.  Anyway.. I logged on Shang while you were gone and went to Xanadu to try and not be bored.
When I left, some guy followed me out and struck up roleplay.  Nothing happened sexually though he did ask if you would lend me out to him.  I told him you were the possessive type and that I was pretty happy with you so I had no desire to switch Masters.  He went on to tell me to relate to you that you had excellent taste in clothing for me to be paraded around in.  That I was subserviant enough to make him want me and that he was sure my voice was a shrill scream when being pleasured =p  Wierd people.  Anyway, I wanted you to know though.  Not keeping anything from you at all *hugs*  I thought you might get a kick out of knowing someone else wants me but can't have me.  Oh, and ic'ly they struck up a conversation because Carine was looking at piercings at a place right outside the square.  Thinking about getting her tongue or nipples pierced.  Whatcha think?

As for the bond thing...Melinda says she has still to discuss it

`7Subj`6:`7 Lessons
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
I have thought up some lessons for each rank.
Lessons for Private:
1. Basic sword training with shields  stances, how to hold weapon and shield, defensive, offensive moves.
2. Etiquette and image importance of making us look good, being polite to the client.
3. Scouting and tracking search and rescue scenarios, locating someone, ways to sneak through an area undetected (lesson probably out in the forest.)
Lessons for Corporal:
1. Archery  improving aim, trying different bows, including crossbow, correct technique.
2. Basic hand to hand combat Kicks, correct punching, block and dodge.
3. Daes Daemar (dealing with nobles.) Subterfuge, disguises, spying, the power of rumour.
4. Practice with another weapon of choice ( quarterstaff, axe, knives.)
Lessons for Sergeant:
1. Advanced sword  further practice with the sword.  
2. Advanced martial arts palm heel strikes, how to roll properly, flying kicks, spinning kicks, low spin tripups.
3. Hostage situations, protect the hostage.  Bodyguarding.
4. Battle tactics. (The hedgehog, the importance of higher ground, forming a shield wall by linking shields, pincer attacks, terrain, retreat and regroup etc.)
Lessons for Lieutenant:
1. Command training  how to organise men, assertiveness, punishment, responsibilities, never leave a man behind!
2. Shadowspawn briefing. includes how to kill fades, their connection with Trollocs, the danger of the black blade, the danger of looking at a fades face for too long.
3. Challenge the current Lieutenant Commander to a spar to become a Lieutenant Commander too.  Only if you win can you be one.  The Captain watches and judges the fight. ???
And then the Lieutenant Commanders do not have any lessons, but thier duties increase, (intelligence gathering, advisor to the captain, seeking out new jobs.)
So what do you think Kheldon?  Quite a broad range of things to learn here right?  I think it should do nicely but if you have any other suggestions let me know. :)

I set you up with the stuff I could think of - on BP,
you have grant (so you can grant other people the following
OLC commands), set (for set <player> <zone number that you're
giving them access to>), zedit, redit, oedit, and goto.  When
you grant a player a command, make sure you only give it to them
on BP - do:

grant Rasridim goto 9696

If you don't do the port argument, then it gives them imm
commands on this port if they're using their mort's name.
I'm not sure what it takes to create a new zone - we're gonna
have to ask Ranulf (the old head builder) or syrah, if she
knows.  Right now zone 407 is the active one that Kinje and
Ranulf are working on.  Faerid is about done with the eq ones
(I think they were 37, maybe 38 and 39, but I don't remember
for certain).  Oh, come to think of it, you may have to grant
them things like show, for zone info, and vstat and such.  But
what I gave you is the essentials, I think.

If you need anything else, beep me. :>

`7Subj`6:`7 Lesson credit for Tavik and Belfor.
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Aight I'll do this in order.
Tavik... Credited with Alternate Weapon style (Archery).
It was appaerent that Tavik has prior knowledge in archery IC, so with a bit of twisting I pushed a lesson
defining the appropriate use, situations for use and tactics for Archery.

Balfor... Credited with Alternate weapon style (Archery) and basic tactics.
As with Tavik, Balfor displayed a prior knowledge of archery and so was included into the lesson with Tavik.
Ontop of this, Balfor was taught varying basic knowledge of ambush techniques within covered terrain and
appropriate useages of both Bow and Sword within these situations.

(Note)- Timothy also participated in the lesson, but my connection dropped before I could find out just what
he did and didn't have. Stay tuned and I'll make the appropriate mails when I speak to him next.

Ta muchly, and if these mails should be going elsewhere, tell me asap :)

Essie.

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
I've either talked or received mails from everybody involved,
now, and given what people are telling me (unless anyone
of you guys can provide me with a log to prove that someone
is lying), I've pretty well established what was most likely
to have happened.  The conversation you referred to that
occured early in March was not snooped in any way - the
sole way for any of those gsays to have been overheard
without the use of an imm code snooping would be a mischan.
No imm (besides the exceptions of Boris and Varulv, who
both had permission on an unrelated bug issue) has snooped
any one of you or any of the people involved in this as
far back as syslog goes (Feb 10).  I've concluded that
the people who found out about it discovered the information
through other means, and from the accounts I'm hearing,
that information has become a fairly obvious connecting of
the dots based on information that was shared or guessed
at by a number of players.  My investigation leads me to
believe that none of this information was obtained through
the illegal use of code or through actions that constitute
policy violations.  As for Tavik's identity, I'm not sure
how people found out about that.  His identity appears to
be considered, contrary to his own belief, common knowledge
to players that play (or have played) on Fang and here, but
I cannot prove how that info was determined by the people
involved here.  There is no evidence to suggest policy
violations or code abuse in obtaining any of this information.

As for the possible unacceptable conduct of some of the
players involved in this, the other players are offering
radically different versions of each of the related
conversations.  In order to justify the use of policy action
against any individual for inappropriate behavior towards
you or anyone else involved in this, I'll need a log to
show it, because absolutely everyone involved has such
a great difference of opinion of what happened in each
conversation (especially including parties who don't much
care) that I cannot look at this as anything more than
a 'he said, she said' matter.  Not only do the details
not agree with each other, but all players I've questioned
disagree on many of the basic facts, up to and including
"I never did that" and "I never heard so and so say anything
about this".  I'm sorry, but this is as much as I can do
without logs to prove who was acting inappropriately and
how.  From the facts and the evidence, my conclusion is
inappropriate behavior was likely involved on several
people's parts, but I lack sufficient evidence and witnesses
to say that as a certainty, or to say who started what.
Other players involved in this logged their own complaints
as well.  Without logs from any of you or them, no policy
action is legal.

I'm sorry for what happened, and for the embarrassment.
I wish I could have cleared things up further, but the
conflicting testimonies of everybody prevents me from
doing so.  If you or anyone else is ever harrassed or
otherwise the victim of inappropriate behavior, please
log it immediately.  In situations where there is no
evidence, and where no players at all can agree on what
they heard or said, I can't do squat without either a
log or something in syslog to indicate to me what happened.

I'm sorry, but this is all I can unless you can prove what
was said in one of the conversations to you or anyone else
involved.  I really don't have anything else to go on.  From
what I believe happened, as I said, given that more people
knew who Tavik was than he thought (and I've been unable
to determine how - they just say they've known forever),
and some conclusions that were fairly easy to assume by
most people in the tower guild, how this got out was
largely a connecting of the dots.  I'm sorry, but a lot
of people were aware of this, and I can't find any evidence
to show that someone broke policy to find out.

Again, if you can find someone with a log, I'll continue
to look into this, but otherwise, I've concluded the
investigation.

`7Subj`6:`7 Tells I missed
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Hey, I guess I missed some tells you sent me while I was
mailing last night - yes, we can add rooms to the
test ports without adding them to the live port.
You would construct them on the builderport, and
then:
from  /../builderport/lib/world
cp wld/407.wld /../mudback/lib/world/wld
cp zon/407.zon /../mudback/lib/world/zon
cp obj/407.obj  /../mudback/lib/world/obj

etc, for each of the file types.  Obviously
there should have been a tilda in front
of each of the /../ in the destination
directory, but you get the idea.  I think
that's right, anyhow, but you can always
doublecheck before you start copying files
over.  Stuff done on the builderport
has to be implemented manually to the

`7Subj`6:`7 Tells I missed
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Hey, I guess I missed some tells you sent me while I was
mailing last night - yes, we can add rooms to the
test ports without adding them to the live port.
You would construct them on the builderport, and
then:
from  /../builderport/lib/world
cp wld/407.wld /../mudback/lib/world/wld
cp zon/407.zon /../mudback/lib/world/zon
cp obj/407.obj  /../mudback/lib/world/obj

etc, for each of the file types.  Obviously
there should have been a tilda in front
of each of the /../ in the destination
directory, but you get the idea.  I think
that's right, anyhow, but you can always
doublecheck before you start copying files
over.  Stuff done on the builderport
has to be implemented manually to the
live port, so we simply just don't
import it if we don't want it here yet.

That help?

I mailed this to Afton yesterday, not realizing you'd
been deleted, and forgot to forward it.  Sorry.

I've either talked or received mails from everybody
involved now, with the exception of Mishaela and Eilana,
because I didn't think they were witnesses to any of
the conversations in question (beyond being present in
the gsay conversation with Sionet and yourself).  If
they've got any logs to present or can present some
compelling argument as witnesses, I'll talk to 'em,
otherwise I've done all I can.  Since the only proof
I was able to find without logs from anyone at all was
what definitely didn't happen, this is what I've
established is most likely to have occurred.

The conversation you referred to that happened in early
March was not snooped in any way - the sole way for
any of those gsays to have been overheard without the
use of the imm snoop code is a mischan.  No imm (besides
the exceptions of Boris and Varulv, who both had
permission by Sionet on an unrelated bug issue) has
snooped any one of you or any of the people involved in
this as far back as syslog goes (Feb 10).  I've concluded
that the people who found out about it discovered the
information through other means, and from the accounts
I'm hearing, that information was probably a fairly
obvious connecting of the dots based on information
that was shared or guessed at by a number of players.
My investigation leads me to believe that none of this
information was obtained through the illegal use of
code or through actions that consitute policy violations.
As for Tavik's identity and the fact that she's female,
I'm not sure how people found out about that.  Her
identity appears to be considered, contrary to her
own belief, common knowledge to players that play (or
have played) on Fang and here, but I cannot prove how
that info was determined by the people on this mud.
I simply have no evidence to pinpoint who was involved
in any policy violations or code abuse, if there was
any, in obtaining this information.  Players appear
to have made the conclusion drawn based on rumor and
what they knew/saw between Tavik and your OOC
relationship, probably use of the where command
when you were RPing, and went from there.

As for the possible unacceptable conduct of some of
the players involved in this, the other players are
all offering radically different versions of a number
of related conversations.  They differ from your
accounts, and each others, to the extent that I
can't do anything with any of them without logs on
any of your parts, because it's entirely a case of
'he said', 'she said', now.  In order to justify
the use of policy action against any individual for
inappropriate behavior towards you or anyone else
involved in this, I'll need a log.  From the facts
and the evidence, my conclusion is that inappropriate
behavior was likely involved on several people's
parts, but I lack any evidence and collaborating
witnesses to say that as a certainty (especially since
some of the participants claim they were never
involved in any such conversation, or that what
they heard was drastically different from what the
previous player I talked to told me), or to say
who started what.  Other players involved in this
logged their own complaints as well.  Without logs
from you or any of them, no policy action is legal.

I'm sorry for what happened, and for the embarrassment.
I wish I could have cleared things up further, but the
conflicting testimonies of everybody prevents me
from doing squat without evidence, since I can't even
get two witnesses to agree on anything.  I've posted
a change in how I'm dealing with policy matters from
now on in the hopes that it will make it easier to
crack down on problems like this when they occur.  In
the future, if someone is acting inappropriate to you
and it's serious enought to warrant policy action,
just make a log and forward it as I outlined in the
post to the appropriate person, and it should be taken
care of then and there.  I'm hoping that my harsher
stance on this will firstly keep it from happening so
much in the first place, and get rid of problem players
here that can't keep their mouths shut.

Unless you can find a log or you have a witness to
something, this is as far as I can go with what I've
got.

Laeona Tibra grew up in the southern part of Saldaea, for the better half of 
fifteen years of her life. She had a mostly normal life her father Darmon was
a farmer of one of Saldaea's famous crops the Ice Pepper, as well as a little
bit of hunting for furs for his wife. Her mother Diedeadra was a seamstress,
she took the few furs that Luna's father got and made them into warm clothing
she also made some of the most wonderful clothes that anyone in the area had
seen. But this life was not for Luna she never picked up on any of the sewing
that her mother tried so hard to teach her. Instead she spent most of her life
following her dad around, and trying hard to pick up every bit about hunting 
that she could, from the time she was eight till she was about thirteen she
wanted to be a hunter and sell furs for a living. But all that changed once
she was able to have some freedom, and she began to see the world, the local
inn mostly, she liked to go there and talk to the local hunters. But one day
as young minds are feeble, she found a profession that she truly wanted she
wanted to be a Gleemen. She watched how the Gleemen attracted so much 
attention, and drew large crowds, so she began to observe the woman Gleeman's
actions as much as she could. After the Gleewoman left town Luna began to pursue
this talent as much as she could, she began to learn how to juggle the knives
that her father gave her, and then also picked up on playing the harp, and
she began to play for the local inns. Bored with the daily routine of life
she set out to find a real Gleeman so that she could apprentice and become
a full Gleeman. 
  
Upon her travels she met a group of women who were traveling
to Tar Valon. These women were very interested in Laeona, and found her
talents very interesting, so interesting that they persuaded her into going
to Tar Valon with them. Later on when she folowed them she began to find out
thier stories as each revealed a little more the longer they went. One of the
women was an Aes Sedai, who had just found out that the other girl could channel
and was escorting her to Tar Valon to get trained. The other woman, who was going
to get trained had came from a small village in Saldaea not to far from Laeona
herself. Come to find out the Aes Sea had been staying in the village, for what 
reason Laeona could not gather, when she had noticed that the woman was about to 
spark. The Aes Sedai then persuaded the woman to come to Tar Valon to be trained.
As the two women spoke to Laeona she became curious, and excited at the same time.
She began to beg the Aes Sedai to test her to see if she could go to Tar Valon 
and learn too. Reluctantly it seemed the Aes Sedai tested her, and seemed 
surprised at the potential Laeona had, and at that moment she made Laeona 
promise that she would continue her journey to Tar Valon with them and to begin 
her training as well. Leaona willingly agreed, and the three women continued thier
travels to Tar Valon.

Anastasia,

   After reading your last letter to Beonca and myself, I wanted to sit down
and speak with you in person about the status of the guild, and how we
could improve activity, as well as address the points you raised about Aviendha.
Fael has guilded me into the guild so I can help out, and I've spoken with
a number of players about the guild and your role in it.  I have to admit
that I am disappointed with what I've found and been told.  It appears that
you've taken little active role there and no initiative to get the guild started
up again, going back t only a couple of weeks since you were hired.  You don't
log on enough to carry out the basic requirements of keeping a small guild
active, and you haven't done so for a very long time.  In the body of your
last mail, you basically blamed me for the current status of the AL.  I feel
it's necessary to point out that the only reasons you gave for why Aviendha
would generate RP all went back to her connections with the tower - which is
already flooded with bookies and does nothing to address the A guild, or any
of the other points that I gave you that must be satisfied before I auth
another bookie.  Furthermore, your note that yo uhad to take a week off just
to cool down to the point where you could blame me for the guild indicates
to me that either you're not even-tempered enough to handle this job, or
you don't care enough about it to act with more maturity.

I can find only minimal evidence of your activity anywhere - a post on
the template board - but most players tell me that you haven't doen much of
anything at all.  I also note that you don't read the boards, like proj
show, whic his frankly unacceptable for a GL.  I don't feel that you're
willing to put in the effort or professionalism required to do this job,
and consequently, after speaking with Beonca, Fael and some of your
guildmembers, I've decided to remove you from your position and replace
you with someone else.  I GLed the Seafolk for a number of years, and I
quite understand that sometimes no amount of effort will turn a guild 
around during a dry spell - but you've made none at all, and in your last
mail, all you did was threaten to quit if I didn't do what you wanted.
That's unacceptable.  I'm sorry we weren't able to make more of a difference,
but I stand by my reasoning for denying the Aviendha character.  Given the
current state of the AL guild, it cannot handle the bookie, it won't
generate RP for anyone but towerites and it will cause more of the problems
I'm already seeing with the number of bookies we have already.  I am
taking more of an active role in the guild, however, and hope that we'll
be able to make some progress with it when the finals-crunch-time slump
ends and we get more active as a whole.

Sincerely,
Nicodemus

I set the name and desc fields the same and had them stand

Since you went linkdead, I saved the last three emotes from Alton and myself. We decided it was late and we're going to get some sleep. We can continue this from where we left off when we're all on again. BTW, if what I said on TTA is what made you leave, I didn't mean to make you angry. If you just happened to go linkdead at that moment, then heheh, what a coincidence. Anyways, next time we're on we should finish it.

`7CC`6: `7Varulv Duren Eliana 

Varulv, Duren and I briefly discussed a new option for
implementing troop movement in the new war system.  It
entails ripping out the existing 'meandering trails'
between major cities, and replacing them with straight-shot
zones coded to scale.  Because of the scaling, PCs and
troops could only move a few rooms per day, IC, so we'd
have to have OLC recognize outdoor terrain types (the
existing ones may be sufficient - not sure offhand), and
movement between these rooms would have to cost a lot of
endurance in code.  I think this eliminates all the problems
we have with the previously examined options, though it
does require some extra work.  Here's what we'd need:

Eli and V, please look at your milage estimates between
cities and decide how many rooms we'd need to place
between existing cities (those zones would remain untouched).
My initial guess is that something like 3 code rooms
would be about as much as a marching army can handle
per day - much more, and we'd have to code way too many
rooms, and much less and people who accidently stepped
out of a city would be unable to get back to it in a
reasonable amount of time :p Once we get an idea of how
many rooms we'd need, we'll decide if this is doable.

Provided the room numbers aren't too great, we put together
a set of generic room descs for the major terrain types.
We'd repeat them over and over, and make all zones out of
these generic descs.  We could even do this to make a
'template' zone, copy if into multiple zones, and then
connect the dots around the edges and add important
features as necessary.

This would allow us to really enforce code=IC in all
instances I can think of, and allows for a maximum of
PC interaction with traveling and camped armies.  We
can implement scouting, sneaking away from cities, trade
embargoes and IC mailing this way, and it'd all be
totally representable IC.  Codewise, as far as the zones
go, the only major adjustments need to be the movement
costs to PCs and troops depending on the terrain type,
which obviously has to be hard coded.  I don't think that's
a big deal, is it, Duren? I think this about hits the
major points of this.  Zones should be giant squares, also,
to allow for people skirting around army bodies and the
like (everybody needs to be able to move in all 4 cardinal
directions all the time, though moving through dense forest
should be harder than following the trail).  We'll just
add trails to connect the cities through the template zones,
and as we get more players, we'll rewrite the descs to
make them better, down the road.

Thoughts?

Hey, thought you'd be interested in this.  We're thinking
about replacing all the unscaled zones between cities with
zones that better represent travel time, for the war code.
They'd be square zones of generic descs, but we'd add higher
movement costs to represent traveling greater distances
per room (armies would only be able to go a few outdoor
rooms per IC day).  The zones would be square so you could
hack your way through any direction, but it'd obviously
be fastest/easiest to follow the trails.  Since presumably
nobody would RP in these areas for the most part, we'd
just make basic descs and use them over and over again.
We could make a template zone of 10x10 rooms, and just
copy it into different zone numbers, then connect them
around the edges and place in any absolutely necessary
trails or landmarks.  The staff mail is forwarded below.

Ok, we're each on the building team for this - we're jokingly
calling it the 'Meanding Trails" project.  As of right now,
here's the plan:

Varulv and Boris are drawing up a grid map of Randland.  We're
going to use that to establish what scale to use, soon as they're
done.

Duren says that there is no max we need to be concerned with
on the number of zones we're adding.  However, we will be removing
(not deleting!) the out of date zones that no one uses, because
they are sucking up a lot of our memory.  We'll keep them backed
up (they already are) so we can recycle some of them at a later date.

After we establish how many zones we're going to need to map
Randland, we'll be doing the following:
*disconnect all the existing 'travel' zones that nobody
   uses - trails, wierd areas, etc.  We'll disconnect the
   exits and then delete their entries from the index file
   so they aren't loaded when we reboot anymore.
*leave existing cities and RP centers as they are, and reconnect
   them to our new zones
*the new zones will be square (10 rooms x 10 rooms).  We'll create
   a template zone that we'll just copy over and over again onto
   the grid, then connect the edges so that the entire world exists
    as a generic grid.  Then, we'll go through and overwrite generic
   descs with specific ones.
*generic descs will be overwritten with specific ones - this means
   we'll be placing the major roads and rivers first, followed by
   landmarks, and someday we'll be able to rewrite all descs to
   make them unique again, as well as add mobs (some day we'll
   have scripting in place for most mobs).

We'll decide how many zones we're going to put in between cities
based on the map Varulv and Boris are drawing up.  This will
probably be the last 'big' building project we ever do, until
we put in special procedure mobs.

going to use that to establish what scale to use, soon as they're
done.

Duren says that there is no max we need to be concerned with
on the number of zones we're adding.  However, we will be removing
(not deleting!) the out of date zones that no one uses, because
they are sucking up a lot of our memory.  We'll keep them backed
up (they already are) so we can recycle some of them at a later date.

After we establish how many zones we're going to need to map
Randland, we'll be doing the following:
*disconnect all the existing 'travel' zones that nobody
   uses - trails, wierd areas, etc.  We'll disconnect the
   exits and then delete their entries from the index file
   so they aren't loaded when we reboot anymore.
*leave existing cities and RP centers as they are, and reconnect
   them to our new zones
*the new zones will be square (10 rooms x 10 rooms).  We'll create
   a template zone that we'll just copy over and over again onto
   the grid, then connect the edges so that the entire world exists
    as a generic grid.  Then, we'll go through and overwrite generic
   descs with specific ones.
*generic descs will be overwritten with specific ones - this means
   we'll be placing the major roads and rivers first, followed by
   landmarks, and someday we'll be able to rewrite all descs to
   make them unique again, as well as add mobs (some day we'll
   have scripting in place for most mobs).

We'll decide how many zones we're going to put in between cities
based on the map Varulv and Boris are drawing up.  This will
probably be the last 'big' building project we ever do, until
we put in special procedure mobs.

`7CC`6: `7Varulv Beonca Boris Ranulf Eliana 

I spent some time working on zone estimates for the continental
map, and came up with two options for zone size.

Option 1:
Tar Valon is 25 rooms north, 9 rooms east of Caemlyn.  This
gives a movement rate of 5 rooms per day for troop mobs.  By
comparison, Aringill is 10 rooms east and 1 room south of Caemlyn.
This makes the continental map 13 zones wide and 11 zones high,
or 143 areas (14300 descriptions).  In other words, you can
walk north across the entire continent in 105 rooms, and east
for 130 rooms.

Option 2:
Tar Valon is 38 rooms north, 14 rooms east of Caemlyn.  Troops
move 8 rooms per day (Aringill would be a trip of 17 rooms, in
this case).  The continent would be 20 zones wide by 16 zones
high, giving an area of 320 zones and 32000 descriptions.

What do you guys think? Any smaller scale than option 1, and
troop mobs will only be moving a couple rooms a day, which
gets lame for tactics and then there's just plain not enough
rooms from one end of the world to the other.  Any larger
scale than option 2, and we pass the point of getting old
and having the internet be outdated before we finish.

I vote option 1.  It's most doable workwise and still gives
us tons of rooms to work with.  However, option 2 is perfectly
feasible, too, but it's the upper end of what we can do provided
lots of us work on it.

Hey Eli, I finished the top two rows of the continent.
I'm working under the assumption that we're going with
143 areas total, cuz I think 320 is just too unwieldy,
and we'll never finish it.  I emailed you the map I'm
working on - I did areas A0 - A9 and B0 - B10 so far.
If you have some time, do you think you can start on row
C? Vnums are listed on the right of the map - C0 is
zone # 240, C1 is 241, etc.  I numbered 'em right to
left cuz we'll eventually code the ocean, but I doubt
we'll ever do the Shara like we're doing the rest of
Randland.  Thanks!

Hey guys, we're ready.  I went ahead and titled the
rooms between Caemlyn and Aringill so the cities line
up, so all you have to do is write descs for those
rooms.  I believe, from the east gate of Caemlyn,
it's 2 e, 1 s, 8 e to get to Aringill.  Aringill is
only half placed atm - what you'll see is a room that
says 'Aringill goes here', but you don't need to worry
about filling that in.  It turns out the Aringill zones
are fairly messy, but I've almost got them sorted out.
The east side of Aringill connects right, but the west
side (the one you're on) isn't connected yet.  I'll
finish Aringill tomorrow.

Hopefully see you guys tomorrow :> Thanks again!

Hey, after we hit some snags with scaling with the current

it's important to do this right, so *shrug*).  The new vnums
for the zones are gonna be 0 - 729.  We're keeping what we

Ok, Caemlyn and Aringill are both marked out on the map
and connected by the road (which is identified by titles
in the rooms, but no descs yet).  From room 44043 (what
will be the east gate of Caemlyn), it's 2 e, 1 s, east til
you hit the west gate of Aringill.  Both Aringill and
Caemlyn occupy 9 squares of the big map (3 rooms x 3 rooms).

What we need are:
Descs for the road.
Descs for the rooms immediately surrounding Caemlyn.  Maybe
   a small scattering of houses/farms?
Somebody to go through the current list of zones (show zone)
   on the live port and pick out which ones are total junk,
   which ones we can steal descs from and which we'll be
   importing exactly as is (like Caemlyn).
About 500 more zones. :p Hopefully Eli and I can do these

Hey, instead of bothering with lockers for dropping cities
why not create an object in the zone with keywords city, (and which one)
that way where city works, as does where (name). Also, if you put it to load into the
zedit, it'll always show up.

Also, I had an idea of how to place smaller homesteads. I've only been using the new 'enter' and 'climb' object code this far for secret rooms.
at this risk of exposing that we have this code. We can start making smaller hamlets, roadside inns, etc, as this sorta thign.

Hey, instead of bothering with lockers for dropping cities
why not create an object in the zone with keywords city, (and which one)
that way where city works, as does where (name). Also, if you put it to load into the
zedit, it'll always show up.

Also, I had an idea of how to place smaller homesteads. I've only been using the new 'enter' and 'climb' object code this far for secret rooms.
at this risk of exposing that we have this code. We can start making smaller hamlets, roadside inns, etc, as this sorta thign.

Check the great tree inn for an example of how they work. Or the forest
outside of caemlyn that has a waterfall

Also, the current setup for andor on the bp.. Are those the right zones that
will be used later, and is the distance between arringil currently the
right amount?

Quit mailing Nico :p Mail me here.

Yup, Aringill and Caemlyn are right on the BP.  I imported their
zones 'out in space' and am gonna import the rest of the continent
around those zone numbers, but everything about them is right on
the BP by this scale.  I think Mat is currently writing descs for
the Aringill/Caemlyn road.

That craft/econ stuff is pretty neat.  Need coders tho.

   Hey guys, I'm around but since this place has been dead I've
   been spending my free time in the real world.  Duren said that
   he thinks we should keep working on our projects as we get time,
   but  I mostly feel that I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing until
   we get a small group of people together with some more free time
   than anybody's had lately.  In the meantime, if you guys want
   to pick at stuff we need, here's the list:

   Serai, on creation, with the last version of the talent lists we
     sent.  We'll do the final version of those further down the road.

   Duren, on the OLC-style interface for bodypart lists.

   Mac, on the continent.  For my part, I'll add some more zones
     and I guess the other priority (as always) is combat.

   These all need to be finished before we can get the mud on its
    feet again.  I just don't want to be a solo act anymore - but as
   soon as you guys are up for some more activity and we can
   beat on these projects as a group, I'll be here.  Lemme know

`7Subj`6:`7 BG for Daes Daemer Guidl
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Born into the nobility of the ruling line of Mayene, Nicolas was named one of the 
half dozen that carry the title the Second of Mayene should the First fall to the numerous 
assassination attempts of the Tairens.  His father had passed away through one of these 
attempts a few months before his death, a Tairen assassin trying to thin out the line of 
Mayene's ruling house.  His mother was depressed after this, and was lost in conceiving 
the boy, who was at birth considered an orphan.  This did not seem to weigh to heavily on 
the child's extended family who took him in to live at the palace with his uncle who was 
at the time the First of Mayene.
His uncle saw the boy as an opportunity to tie the small country to one of the most 
powerful forces in the land.  At the age of twelve Nicolas sur Paendrag Paeron was sent 
to the White Tower to train under the tutelage of the Gaidin.  His journey across the land 
was spent with two young girls, and an Aes Sedai who had spent the last few years as an 
advisor to his uncle but had to return to the Tower to deliver the two girls for training 
after she'd discovered their abilities to channel.
His training only commenced soon after his thirteenth birthday, when they finally 
arrived through their long journey.  His time with the warriors of Tar Valon, only lasted 
seven years at first, when after his training was complete he served as a Sergeant in the 
Tower Guard for a little over two years before taking a leave of absence to return home at 
the news of the death of the First of Mayene.
The choice to return to Mayene was not his, as all of those who hold the title of 
Second must return for the choosing of a new ruler of the small country.  Though the 
thought of ruling the small nation wasn't the most exciting thing the man had on his 
mind, he was still slightly disappointed to see his younger cousin appointed.
He was left a highly trained man, with little to do.  While still being a noble in 
Mayene, he'd never really grown accustomed to the lifestyle there after growing up 
through most of his young adulthood in Tar Valon, and the provocativeness of his home 
land honestly made the man a little nervous.  
          He traveled far in his youth, staying in inn's across the world but never gaining 
much recognition from others because most of the major nobles would not have much to 
do with a Mayener noble who would not be very valuable to advance their own status in 
the Daes Daemar.  It seemed that the man's days were spent more wandering, picking up 
knowledge of the world and getting older as his time went on.
In time he was compelled back to what was home for Nicolas, the isle of Tar 
Valon, where after his almost five year absence where he took up where he left off with 
the Gaidin.  He severed his connections with the Tower Guard and took up a post as an 
instructor, looking to further the training of the new students that would grace the training 
yards.

I've been rather disconnected from the MUD and game in general for over a year now and this is my first log onto this char in that time.
The only reason I was ever a builer was to build Far Madding however I realized that the project was far outside my meager scope of abbility.
I created the hall of the consuls and thats as far as I got, kinda left off trying to figure out how to lay out a triangular island in a square world.  Oh well.  If you wanna use what I started out here go for it, don't think i'll even be logging onto this char for a while.

Hey, you gotta leave the Mikki and Dini credit in the wizlist - that
was one of the 'forever' agreements from MM1 and it's also a large
part of the reason there was such a shitstorm the last time it got
deleted.

I'm still working on the BP.  I'm waiting on one piece of help info
from somebody (anybody who knows) and then Mae/Rhia can go to town
linking things together.

I've been thinking about the Craig/Lynn thing.  What I'm worried
about is that after you leave, Craig will set Lynn up at some point
and she'll end up owning the mud, or at least having a high ranking
imm.  I not only don't trust her, but her behavior in the past has
been iconic of some of the worst garbage we've ever had to deal with.
She likes to be vocal, rude and immature, and tries to disguise it as
being more aware of 'what needs to be done' than the rest of us.
She's one of the people who has bitched about everything most of us
have ever done here, and some of the stuff she's said to other
people here is IMO inexcusable.  She's entitled to her opinions,
but she's not the sort of person that would run a mud fairly or
well.  Like I said, I used to think we were friends, but if you
want what she thinks about me, look at some of her live journal
entries about me and the rest of us - when things weren't going
her way, she passed those around so that I would know about them but
couldn't really do anything about cuz it was her right to say
whatever she wants about me so long as it wasn't technically here.
Far as I'm concerned, she's one of the people that was very close
to a perma siteban because she was causing so much unrest in
several guilds, and just generally ruining all the fun for the
rest of us.  While I've always been cool with Craig from the SF,
we both know he's wrapped around her and I do not want him to be
her way in to the staff.  It's another Kane/Giulietta disaster
waiting to happen, and I'm really worried that her influence is
going to affect the personality and general atmosphere of the mud.
If it comes down to it when you need to go, I'd be more willing
to pay the bill again than to let either one of them be imps.

I hope this didn't sound like a rant, but the woman really ticks
me off, especially since I've always been very fair and listened
to her whenever she wanted and all it's ever gotten me is cussed
out to anybody who'll listen.  Half the people on staff used to
be very good friends with her (I've heard the 'like sisters' thing
you mentioned before), and now I don't know anybody besides Faerid
that likes her at all.  Some of the stuff she's done/said around/to
is, as far as they're concerned, flat out betrayal and backstabbing.
Please, please, please don't set either one of them up in a position
where she can get into staff after you're gone.  It'd be like giving
Giuls the mud, only Lynn still has friends here she hasn't stabbed
in the back yet.

Anyways, I'm sorry to talk bad like this about someone you're friends
with.  Just be careful - she's eventually turned on just about
everybody that ever liked her here, and some of the other women
still feel hurt by it.

Anyway. :/ How'd your date go?

waiting to happen, and I'm really worried that her influence is
going to affect the personality and general atmosphere of the mud.
If it comes down to it when you need to go, I'd be more willing
to pay the bill again than to let either one of them be imps.

I hope this didn't sound like a rant, but the woman really ticks
me off, especially since I've always been very fair and listened
to her whenever she wanted and all it's ever gotten me is cussed
out to anybody who'll listen.  Half the people on staff used to
be very good friends with her (I've heard the 'like sisters' thing
you mentioned before), and now I don't know anybody besides Faerid
that likes her at all.  Some of the stuff she's done/said around/to
is, as far as they're concerned, flat out betrayal and backstabbing.
Please, please, please don't set either one of them up in a position
where she can get into staff after you're gone.  It'd be like giving
Giuls the mud, only Lynn still has friends here she hasn't stabbed
in the back yet.

Anyways, I'm sorry to talk bad like this about someone you're friends
with.  Just be careful - she's eventually turned on just about
everybody that ever liked her here, and some of the other women
still feel hurt by it.

Anyway. :/ How'd your date go?

rooms in its zone that aren't part of the city, and
they need to be removed.  Also, starting to write
descs for the road that connects them would be great.
I think it's about 17 rooms long.

Mostly it's writing descs for the countryside surrounding
Caemlyn and Aringill, and the road that connects the
two.  What I did was rip out the old trails and replace
them with a big rectangular area (30 rooms east-west,
10 rooms north-south).  The entire city of Caemlyn
is inserted into one room towards the west side
of this big map, and the entire city of Aringill is
inserted into one room on the east side.  If you're
interested, the descs are generic and need to be
changed so that the road between the two cities
doesn't have the same desc as the surrounding countryside,
like it currently does, and as you/anybody else
gets time, the rooms around the two cities should
be updated too.  The vast majority (something like
1200) exits are connected and correct, but Boris
is reloading the whole map so the breaks between
the zones need to be connected around the east-west
edge, and the city exits need to be reconnected.
I already wrote up all the vnums and links - I
just need somebody to go through and punch them
in.

This has been a fun project when you're not
working on it by yourself all the time.  If you can
talk a friend or two into doing it with you, it's
more fun than being on the live port most of the time.
You'll see why when you start running circuits
around Caemlyn and using the new ethereal marker
system to bounce between cities :p It's kinda funny.

Anyway, if you're up for it, lemme know.

K.  I can't do it today but tomorrow I probably can.  Help me harrass Duren or
Boris into fixing the raid bug, and Boris into finishing the script.  In case
they go 'what's the raid bug', it:

Crashes the BP and corrupts the zone you were rediting.
Has something to do with raid and redit.
Crashes when you redit a room with the 'raid' flag on.
Crashes when you redit a room with a raided desc that has
somehow gotten corrupted (when you type redit, you'll notice
that suddenly the raided desc is all fubared - crash follows
shortly after).
Requires the reboot file to be removed and the corrupted zone
to be either removed or reloaded from scratch in order to reboot
properly.  Otherwise, it goes into a recursive loop and
monopolizes envy's server.

There's only limited stuff we can do on the BP until these two
things get done.  Soon as they are done, though, it won't take
much to get lots of the rest of things finishes.

For crap's sake bro, we've gone over this so many times I can't believe
you're asking me again.  It happens for a bunch of reasons - mess with
redit in any room where the raid desc is enabled, or just edit a raided
desc in redit until it crashes.  It happens pretty much no matter how you
screw with raid, but I suspect it's directly linked to a problem with redit.
It's pretty easy to make happen - just about any way you play with, edit
or adjust raid causes first obvious corruption, then an inevitable crash
shortly after.  The crash can't recover until the zone (now corrupted) is
either restored or removed, and sometimes you have to remove the
reboot.txt file (1 in 15 times or so, in my experience - I'd forgotten all
about it til you found it this time).

There are no error messages in game, and I can't remember off the
top of my head what syslog says.  The first evidence is usually file
corruption - the room you're working in starts to look like random text
mixed in with spliced room descs.   The crash happens at different
times - sometimes it's as soon as you type redit in a corrupted room,
sometimes it's while you're rediting the room (as you work thru the
menus all the sudden the raid desc is messed up, crash follows shortly).
I don't think it's ever crashed when I was saving the room, though,
always either in redit or after I'd redited the room, after obvious
corruption has occured.  It's real easy to get to happen, just do anything
to the raid desc and redit repeatedly until it goes down.  It affects any
room you do this to - adding new raided descs causes it, playing with
existing raided descs causes it, turning the raid desc on and then
rediting that room causes it.  Also, if you try and reboot without removing
or restoring the corrupted zone, it can't recover and we just eat up
all of the CPU until envy goes down :p

I looked at your zone, B - except for the crash Serai reported shortly
after, the zedit new command (is that what you used?) did create all
four files for the zone and it updates the index files properly.  The only
thing I noticed was that your versions of 3.obj and 3.mob didn't have
the exact same data as our original accepted 'template' files for blank
zones, so I overwrote yours with those but I don't think it should have
made a difference.  As far as the crash goes, no idea.  I did a copyover
after playing with the files and it came up just fine.  I renamed your
zone on the show zone list, and it saved fine.  It's not lagging now,
so I dunno - it may have just been your link. *shrugs* You guys can
try and create zones this way if you like - if it keeps crashing, then
we know there's a bug in it still, but it looks ok.

Syrah, I'll import zone 1 with the other 'keeper' zones once we get
a list together.  It's kinda less tedious to do them in groups.

I looked at your zone, B - except for the crash Serai reported shortly
after, the zedit new command (is that what you used?) did create all
four files for the zone and it updates the index files properly.  The only
thing I noticed was that your versions of 3.obj and 3.mob didn't have
the exact same data as our original accepted 'template' files for blank
zones, so I overwrote yours with those but I don't think it should have
made a difference.  As far as the crash goes, no idea.  I did a copyover

Hey I asked Boris to do it...but I'm not sure if he
can port it over properly or not. Anyway, can you make
sure that our new newbie zone gets ported over, Zone 3.
The old Zone 3 can be deleted. And you'll have to bring in
Zone 160 with it too. I don't think Nico has messed up Zone
160 too much...Additionally I need the default recall changed
to room 300. *The new newbie Zone that is in Caemlyn* And
make sure that after you get done creating you wind up in room
300.

Thank you.

PS When your done go ahead and copy it over please? I'll
post on it as soon as it is done.

Re: Sudo - k. :p

For the world files, I looked 'em over carefully and there's a
couple things.  Firstly (not your fault), the template file you
had was missing something, so I added it and resaved it as
200.wld.  When we do this for real, use 200.wld as your template.

Secondly, your loop for file creation appears to be off in a
couple of minor ways.  For instance, row A needs to consist
of znums 200-225, not 200-224.  Row B is 230 - 255, not 231
to 244.  Every row is 26 rooms, and columns start at #00,
#30, and #60 for #'s 2 - 8.  The last row is just 900 - 925.

Also, don't save 'em as .wld.bak files in the final version - they'll
have to be straight .wld files.  We'll also need the accompanying
index file (see  /../builderport/lib/world/wld/index) with all
the new zone numbers added.

For the remaining file types (.obj, .mob and .zon), use the
template 240 (not 200).  240.obj, 240.mob and 240.zon will
work for all, and we need them numbered exactly the same
as the .wld files.  Also, each of those 3 file types has an
accompanying index file that's exactly the same as the
world index file except every reference of .wld is changed to
.obj, .mob or .zon, respectively.

Otherwise, this is perfect.  Just need you to use the new
200.wld template and to get the loop working correctly, and
we're gold.  The text in the files is 100%.  Nice work :>

Check  /areafile_test .  It should be there by the time you log on, it's uploading
to my directory now.  I went ahead and fixed the loops, and checked the numbers.
It should be right.  I didn't check out the new 200.wld template, so if I missed
and instance of the vnum, let me know.  Other than that, I've included the .zon,
.obj, and .mob files as well as .wld, each in their own directory.  All that
remains is for you to check them for correctness, and then fix the index files.
The index file is in each directory.  You go in there and add whichever zones
we're keeping aside from the ones I just made, and then go ahead and copy the
files over.  I've made them in .bak format so there's no risk of overwriting
(I think for example we have a new and good 300 area that shouldn't get over-
written.)  All you have to do is mv (or cp) *.bak * and it should do them.
That's why it's 200.wld.bak, for example

Dude, we're soooo close.  All four file types are 100% - I
used diff -u on each of them against my originals and they
came out perfectly.  Your file creation loop is still wrong
tho - one row out of every 100 znums is short by 10 zones.

For the second row, it should create files for 230-255, and it
only does it for 230-245.  The index file is also missing
these 10 zones for every hundred znums.  That is - your first
and third row are fine, but your second row (and every
respective row beginning at #30 needs to go to #55 so that
it's 25 rooms wide.  Currently they all stop at #45).

Also - don't save them as .bak files, seriously.  Duren doesn't
know of a way to mass-convert them to just .zon or whatever
files and neither do I, so the BP won't recognize them at all.
Don't worry about overwriting - the zone you mean is zone 3, not
300.  There is no overlap between what you're uploading and
what's currently there that doesn't need to get overwritten.
Just leave 'em as .mob and .wld, etc.

I plan to seek the Gleemen...but only after my background has been
Approved by you.

Elaena Harshare grew up in the southern part of Saldaea, for the better half 
of eighteen years of her life. She had a mostly normal life her father Darmon 
was a farmer of one of Saldaea's famous crops the ice pepper, as well as a 
little bit of hunting for furs for his wife. Her mother Diedeadra was a 
seamstress, she took the few furs that Elaena's father got and made them into 
warm clothing to help the family out as much as possible during the harsh 
winter months. But this life was not for Elaena she never picked up on any of 
the sewing that her mother tried so hard to teach her. Instead she spent most 
of her life following her dad around, and trying hard to pick up every bit 
about hunting that she could, from the time she was eight till she was about 
thirteen she wanted to be a hunter and sell furs for a living, of course her 
being an only child, and her father who had always wanted to ahve a boy allowed 
this, but only when her mother could not discover what he was teaching thier 
daughter. But all that changed once she was able to have some freedom, and she 
began to see the world, the local inn mostly, she liked to go there and talk to 
the local hunters. But one day as young minds are feeble, she found a profession 
that she truly wanted she wanted to be a Gleemen. She watched how the Gleemen 
attracted so much attention, and drew large crowds, so she began to observe the 
man's actions as much as she could. After the Gleemen left town Elaena began to 
pursue this talent as much as she could, she began to learn how to juggle the 
knives that her father gave her, and then also picked up on playing the harp, 
and she began to play for the local inns. Her family soon found out what she was 
doing, and both mother and father were disappointed in her for even thoguh they 
held different views on how to raise her and what she should become, they both 
agreed that the life of a Gleemen was not a life that they wanted for thier child. 
Elaena, angry with her parents, and wishing to find a gleemen to apprentice under 
to further master her skills set out to find a real Gleeman so that she could 
apprentice and become a full Gleeman. 
   
On her journey she spent a lot of nights camped out in the woods, and one night 
when it was time for her to put up camp she saw a camp fire already made up. 
Introducing herself to her strange company she told her life story to the man 
and woman in the campsite, and then they told theirs. Apparently they were both 
Wolfkin, and lived in the wilderness with wolves, Elaena thought this a very odd 
thing, but kept listening, because perhaps someday she could tell a story about 
it. It is that night that she was told that she could speak to the wolves herself, 
she of course didn't believe them, but upon thier instruction however doubtful she 
was about it, she did make an atempt to 'feel' for the wolves as they called it. 
That is when she found herself able to 'feel' a wolf at the edge of the camp that 
she had not seen there before, this wolf shortly after her discovery, entered the 
camp, to share dinner with the strange couple. Freaked out by the encounter Elaena 
fled from the camp just as soon as she could, despite the couples warnings that 
she should stay with them, to learn more about her 'gift'. The wolves aptly named 
her RushingWind for this, for her music that she played upon her harp reminded them 
of the music the wind made when it flowed through the woods, and her quick escape
from them only added to this new name they had for her. Still in pursuit of her 
dream she came to Caemlyn, but by time she arrived at Caemlyn her eyes were already 
starting to change, and despite the strange couples warnings about her soon to be 
changing eye color Elaena, has discovered that in the cities there are no wolves to 
torture her thoughts, so now she hides in Caemlyn away from the wolves where she can 
persue her dreams.

I plan to seek the Gleemen...but only after my background has been
Approved by you.

Elaena Harshare grew up in the southern part of Saldaea, for the better half 
of eighteen years of her life. She had a mostly normal life her father Darmon 
was a farmer of one of Saldaea's famous crops the ice pepper, as well as a 
little bit of hunting for furs for his wife. Her mother Diedeadra was a 
seamstress, she took the few furs that Elaena's father got and made them into 
warm clothing to help the family out as much as possible during the harsh 
winter months. But this life was not for Elaena she never picked up on any of 
the sewing that her mother tried so hard to teach her. Instead she spent most 
of her life following her dad around, and trying hard to pick up every bit 
about hunting that she could, from the time she was eight till she was about 
thirteen she wanted to be a hunter and sell furs for a living, of course her 
being an only child, and her father who had always wanted to ahve a boy allowed 
this, but only when her mother could not discover what he was teaching thier 
daughter. But all that changed once she was able to have some freedom, and she 
began to see the world, the local inn mostly, she liked to go there and talk to 
the local hunters. But one day as young minds are feeble, she found a profession 
that she truly wanted she wanted to be a Gleemen. She watched how the Gleemen 
attracted so much attention, and drew large crowds, so she began to observe the 
man's actions as much as she could. After the Gleemen left town Elaena began to 
pursue this talent as much as she could, she began to learn how to juggle the 
knives that her father gave her, and then also picked up on playing the harp,

`7CC`6: `7Boris Duren 

Hey, I'm trying to reestablish the BP after uploading all of
Boris' files, and syslog is getting hung up on something
I haven't seen before - "Loading zone files" is the last
thing it tries to do before stalling.  I broke the BP down to
just a few zones (including the critical boot ones for
start rooms), and made new index files so that it should
boot with just the bare minimum of stuff - only it's
doing the exact same thing.  Any ideas what it means
by 'loading zone files' if it's not referring to the index?

Also, Duren, you said there were backups of zones
made daily.  Can I get at the Nov 11 or Nov 12 (early)
backups of zone 3 on the BP? I can't find them.

`7CC`6: `7Beonca Nenae Syrah 

The BP's back up with the ubermap fully imported.  It took a fair
bit of doing, because the number of rooms was bigger than circle
was coded for, so Duren and I had to go through and upgrade
everything - thank him, cuz no way I could have gotten it to work
by myself.  Incidently, Marek's a moron.  His code was some of
the most annoying, and it doesn't work right anyways.

B, I'm real sorry, but I lost any changes you made to zone 3
between Wednesday when I imported it and Thursday when
I started upgrading the BP.  I was able to restore it to the version
that's on there now (same as the live version), but apparently
the daily backup system does not do anything for the BP.  I'm
sorry!

We can do the next two stages of the project at the same time - I'm
going to continue to port over cities and zones as Syrah identifies
the keepers.  Currently, Caemlyn and Aringill are in, as well as
some essential zones that the BP won't run without, and that's it.
I'll be bringing over TV, Cairhien, and other major zones ASAP.
Syrah, any other zones you see that're keepers, recommendations
are helpful and would speed things up as you get time.

At the same time I'm doing this, Syrah can be overseeing the
first real 'builder' phase of the project, where you guys link Caemlyn
and Aringill into their zones, and add in the descs of the surrounding
countrysides.  I sent Syrah a detailed writeup on how to do all of
this.  It includes vnums and specific instructions on exactly what
goes where and what to change.  Mort builders can do any of it.
The descs need to be appropriate to the color coded terrain map I
sent Syrah, and most importantly, the descs for the road between
Caemlyn and Aringill need to be changed from their current generic
desc to unique road descs.  All of this is written out much better
in the files I sent.

Nenae and Beonca, you guys can continue your inns and newbie
zone - I'm very sorry about anything I lost.

I should stress that this is a project that absolutely anybody can
handle - no real building is required anymore, since all the zones
are designed and linked.  All it needs is people, preferrably a
group of them, to go in and write better descs for each of the
existing rooms around the cities.  We're not going to do this for
the entire continent - right now, we're on Caemlyn and Aringill,
and when I import the other major cities, we'll do them similarly.
Any questions, feel free to beep me.  Thank Boris and Duren
for a hell of a job - our world isn't just bigger than other circle muds
now, it's a whole version ahead of them codewise. :p

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
My apologies if you have tried to talk to me whilst I was on the mud, regarding the issues I brought up in mudmail.  I have not recieved any tels from you and thought you were ignoring me... Perhaps I simply forgot to check my playback buffer or it was at a time when I was linkdead.. Anyhow, I am Oswald as well as Simion.  I should have just mailed from one alt to avoid confusion, again, my apologies.  I was surprised to hear that I am the first to bring up the guild being low on activity, as I know Mandi also feels strongly about it.  I know that the whole mud has been lacking with activity, and was unaware of your recent efforts to improve Asha guild activity.  Thats good news though. I would be willing to become a co-GL as I proposed, to help out the guild.  I am on usually in the evenings.  Thats around 5pm-9pm GMT.  I do not know where you are from but I am from the UK so you'll have to work out the time difference from where you are at.  I hope to speak with you soon.
I would send you an application for the position as a GL, but I am unaware of your email address, so here is some information about my past experience with the Asha'man here and on TTA:
I first played Lakkam as a Recruit but grew tired that the character was not going anywhere and deleted him.  Then I created this character (Simion) Early this year.  I am nearly ready to take the test for Soldier rank with him, but he is still a Recruit.  On TTA, I had numerous lessons and reached the rank of Soldier with a character called Aubren.  I rped alot with him and was one of the most active members on that mud.  I reached the rank of Dedicated with Aubren and by that time, I had a great deal of rp experience with the Asha'man.
As I disliked the code system on TTA, I left and came back here to Tyme, hoping to carry on with my character Simion.  I think I have a desire to better the muds I visit and keep coming up with useful things that can be done to improve them, whether the GL's take my advice and use it is another matter though.  I am rather tired with rping too much on muds where the character cannot really go anywhere because of lack of activity, so I feel that now I would be best suited to assume an administrative role whilst still rping to better the Asha'man guild.
Once the guilds on Tyme are functioning better I believe it will draw more players.

with nothing to do, so I recruited them for building.
I sent Caleb and Faris the info needed to get them started
in descing the Zone in the color coded map that I have.
both are good in RP so I would hope that they can follow a
map and describe the rooms as follows, though I will keep
an eye on them. nico I'm making educated guesses on your coloring
save
system since you never told me what the colors meant..
Obviously Blue is water and the red color is road...waht
about the greens? Forest grasses meadows???
Color definitions would be nice.

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Probably the first of several memos.  Zone 131 is part of Cairhien
but appears to be almost entirely junk - of the majority of the 53 rooms
I looked at, I could find only 4 that were a) part of the city and b) were
connected right.  Almost the entire zone is a total loss.  The keeper
rooms I found were 13148-13152 (ok, so 5 rooms).  Rather than port
over a whole zone of totally mislinked and corrupted garbage, can
you look into patching these five rooms into one of the other zones?
I want to junk zone 131, but if you want to keep those 5 rooms we can
append them to an empty spot in another Cairhien zone or something.
What do you think?

Well, as no one informed me or consulted me on the "policy" changes
described in help dreamer I've been handling WK and Dreaming as I
always have, and it's been done, for the last 5-6 years or so since
dreaming has been implemented. There is a general guide for "average"
levels of ability on the guild board, based on guild rank. This is
assumed to be knowledge gleaned from experience and from the guidance
of the wolves, which is significant as can be clearly evidenced by
Hopper's guidance of Perrin and his method of learning T'A'R.
Additionally the skill is taught by Wolfkin to other Wolfkin through
RP (no WK can teach a Dreamer, nor vice versa...I've always been of
the viewpoint that there are some difference in how the interaction
with T'A'R happens between WK and Dreamers. Dreamer's take the more
logical, systematic approach to manipulating T'A'R where for WK it
is more instinctive and intuitive, a tapping into the Wolfkin's
lupine nature as wolves themselves exist as much within T'A'R as
out fo T'A'R). I'd also received approval from Alicia and Nicodemus,
before loosing Faerid, to set the skills as appropriate on those
Wolfkin who could justify the knowledge and ability, due to the
numerous timeline shifts and manipulations, and the scrapping of
skills during the wipe, and have asked Varulv to take that in
my stead, though I'm not sure he heard me the first time :)

Basically, I'm not certain Wolfkin Dreaming should be under the
purview of CM or channeling at all...neither being Wolfkin, nor
the ability to enter the wolfdream have any connection to channeling.
The Goldeneyes talent automatically confers the dreaming ability
and the ability to access and use the Wolfkin dreamskills. It's
always been handled more or less internally within the guild,
and I would like it to stay that way. I am and have been firm in
my stance that no Wolfkin can ICly or should ICly be able to
teach or learn any significant points of dreaming from a non-WK,
so there is no bleed over or leakage in training for you to worry
about having to control or manage.

`7From`6:`7 Calabos
`7Subj`6:`7 Wolfkin application.
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Howdy, I'd like to, you guessed it... Apply!
*drumroll*

Here is my background as it came across in RP:

Calabos lurches into the telling more than continues for the elaborance comes to his lips haltingly, almost as if he were reluctant.  Still, he goes on.  "`&In this clearing there were signs of a very recent skirmish: Broken weapons, broken bodies and many tracks.  Two dead men were there, the mark of the Children on clothing and armor, as well as was the carcass of a wolf.`7"  Falling silent then, the prisoner raises his focus and slowly revolves towards you and for but the blink of an eye, something appears to gleam within that nightmarish dark.  No, it was nothing.  "`&The men had died fighting, I will give them that.  Their bodies were sullied, one man was barely identifiable as such, the other had his throat removed... there was blood everywhere.`7"  Snorting a hint of amusement as an internal aside unfolds, the man continues.  "`&Being the opportunistic sort that I am, I figured I'd be able to more easily get food, get a bed if I wore the trappings of the Children.  I salvaged what I could and left the men were I found them.`7"

Okay, the story is that Calabos here is a homeless opportunist and has been masquerading as a Child of the Light.  This has all been okay'd with Varulv but I wanted to send you my application asap.  Here is my character's description, if needed.


Your eyes take in a young man of less than twenty years, dark of color with a rough texture to his skin. Deeply set within his skull, Twin vents of deep brown, near black, bore out from his skull.  Never appearing at ease,  those avenues of attention are ever in motion, unceasing repetitions of inspection and scrutiny.  Once a solid birch, the figure's hair now lies atop his head in a solid mass of tangled strands as if styling were an unknown luxury.

Indeed the rather severely planed facial features are well reinforced by his attire, the latter quite simply folds of pristine white underlayed by gold and steel.  Most eye-catching is the immaculate cloak, the garment streaming from the front the shoulders the back of his mirrored marching boots.  No less of note is the vivid sunburst boldy situated upon the left breast of the garment itself, the bordering of the cloak embroidered in gold.

Snugly nestled beneath the hems of the cloak lies a steel cuirass, the straps of the breastplate dutifully hidden by the snowy tabard that loosely guards the flanks.  The armor itself is dented and tarnished, hardly worth the name.  Wreathing each forearm is a sheath of steel, such protection not confined to the upper body as greaves of silver, surely once polished, also guard his legs.  Oddly, the various sections of armor are quite motely as if they are members of several different sets of protection.  A simple longsword rides the soldier's hip, the visible hilt and crossguard conspicious in their absence of adornment.

Of course, he is not really a WC and not a WK, yet.  I would very much appreciate your consideration in this as I have a lot of enthusiasm for this characer idea and am looking forward to a lot of RP.

Thanks.

`7CC`6: `7Beonca Varulv 

Hey there, I need you two to give me a list of what zones your guilds are currently using as guild
zones so I don't accidently have them deleted with the area switchover.  There are a few guilds that
appear to have more than one area, but are really only using one of them, which is why I am asking
this of you.

Thanks!

Hey there, I need you two to give me a list of what zones your guilds are currently using as guild
zones so I don't accidently have them deleted with the area switchover.  There are a few guilds that
appear to have more than one area, but are really only using one of them, which is why I am asking
this of you.

Thanks!

`7I got the list of current zones that I want/don't want to use for the new area revamp.  The
areas we keep will have to be incorporated into Nico's large map.

Please review and send me any changes.  Once it's 'finalized', I will send this to whomever gets
the task of porting everything over to the BP.

Please note that most areas that are to be 'ported' do not yet have assigned numbers for the new
Revamp (under the heading "BP#), since I don't want to reassign zones until I know what I am
keeping.  The few that are assigned are becasue they are already on the BP.

Also Note that MP# stands for 'main port' number. Ie: the number of the zone on this port.

PS: Items highlighted in blue (except the two noble houses) are guild areas that I'm not sure

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Hey, went over this with Nenae and Carissa but here's how to
save.  After everybody is done rediting (trying to do this while
somebody is can crash the BP, so wait til you're all ready),
type 'olc'.

This'll bring up a list of zones that need to be saved.  This is
separate from the 'save zone internally?' question you answered
when quitting redit, btw - you have to do this every so often too,
else the next time we reboot/crash everything is lost.

From the list that gets brought up with 'olc', it'll say something
like '640 needs saving'.  To save zone 640, type 'redit save 640'.
I think you can save all zones at once by typing 'OLC save', as well.

Hey Nico,

I wanted to let you know what I did while you weren't looking.  :)

road square is complete in all three zones on the to do list.  The only things left on the whole list is the completed description of the general stuff in the overworld.  (Exactly, the green, blue-green, and blue vnums)

In case anyone starts working on Zone 638 before I start in on it again, FYI, the fork of the river on the RIGHT is the River Alguenya, and the one on the LEFT is the Erinin.

Please feel free to walk the roads and make sure they are what was requested and the descs are good enough.  I will be more than happy to change anything that needs changing - I'm new at this, so I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't do it exactly right.

One possible problem:  the last thing I did during my first session of building was to fix the West Gate of Aringill (vnum 16522).  When I logged back in later, it had reverted back to the way it was before I changed it.  I don't know if it just didn't save correctly, or if I put a West Gate of Aringill in the wrong place somewhere.  I searched around and couldn't find a duplicate in an erroneous vnum, but you never know.  Thought you should be aware either way.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or if you need to yell at me for screwing something up, please let me know.  My alts are Amra, Phaedra, and Embeth.  I'm on almost all day.  (It's 6 am now, and I'm going to bed, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.)

This has been long enough, hopefully I'll be able to talk to you later.  BTW, my husband (alts Janthin and Rowen) is also interested in helping out.  He's off work all day and will be on, too, if you could still use some more volunteers.

thanks!  Carissa

serious ass over there).  Nenae is doing a lot of the descs as well.

Also, regarding your zones - I told you I can't renumber 2 digit zone
numbers - can't do it.  The automated command will mislink half the exits
and doing it by hand takes effin forever - I had to do it to fix Aringill and got
so pissed off I eventually just unloaded everything in it that wasn't
working properly.  Otherwise, tho, which city do you think we should
port over next? Cairhien I've already done detailed recon for, but
Tar Valon is used more - but it's more junk zones too.  I havne't looked
at TV at all beyond noting that there are about a dozen zones reserved
for it for some reason.

This is for the builders and staff.

I'm dazzled by how much everybody's getting done.  Phaedra
just finished the last of the zone 639 descriptions, and
everybody's putting a lot of work into the whole Caemlyn/Aringill
group of zones.  I think next I'd like to add some objects to
the zone to mark things better - like wagon ruts, for example.

For my part, I've been cleaning up Caemlyn some - try it out.
I've added a quick navigation system on the ubermap so you can
teleport to any finished city by typing "goto <city name>".
If you type 'goto caemlyn', you teleport to a marker 'above'
the city zone, in a room labeled 'Ethereal Caemlyn'.  If you
go in any cardinal direction from there, you enter the actual
world at the respective gate of Caemlyn (w,n,e, or s gate).
I'm gonna do this for all the cities we port over.

If you guys have any ideas or projects you'd like to do, please
let me and Syrah know.  I personally am interested in adding
a thieves guild entrance for the Caemlyn Black Lions.  Also,
Ranulf showed me a neat way to place small towns on the map
by using enterable objects, that basically act like gates into
other rooms.  We could note a farmhouse or a small village in
the description of a room, and place an enterable object there
called 'A farmhouse' or 'A town gate' or something, and when
you enter it, you enter a large group of rooms that makes the
whole town or whatever - but it only takes up one room on the
ubermap, so the scale remains correct. :> What do you guys
think?

-Nic
P.S.  Remember to save often, especially with our current bug
problems on the main port.  Type 'olc' and save all the files
listed there periodically, or they'll be lost if we crash!

a thieves guild entrance for the Caemlyn Black Lions.  Also,
Ranulf showed me a neat way to place small towns on the map
by using enterable objects, that basically act like gates into
other rooms.  We could note a farmhouse or a small village in
the description of a room, and place an enterable object there
called 'A farmhouse' or 'A town gate' or something, and when
you enter it, you enter a large group of rooms that makes the
whole town or whatever - but it only takes up one room on the
ubermap, so the scale remains correct. :> What do you guys

This is for the builders and staff.

I'm dazzled by how much everybody's getting done.  Phaedra
just finished the last of the zone 639 descriptions, and
everybody's putting a lot of work into the whole Caemlyn/Aringill
group of zones.  I think next I'd like to add some objects to
the zone to mark things better - like wagon ruts, for example.

For my part, I've been cleaning up Caemlyn some - try it out.
I've added a quick navigation system on the ubermap so you can
teleport to any finished city by typing "goto <city name>".
If you type 'goto caemlyn', you teleport to a marker 'above'
the city zone, in a room labeled 'Ethereal Caemlyn'.  If you
go in any cardinal direction from there, you enter the actual
world at the respective gate of Caemlyn (w,n,e, or s gate).
I'm gonna do this for all the cities we port over.

group of zones.  I think next I'd like to add some objects to
the zone to mark things better - like wagon ruts, for example.

For my part, I've been cleaning up Caemlyn some - try it out.
I've added a quick navigation system on the ubermap so you can
teleport to any finished city by typing "goto <city name>".
If you type 'goto caemlyn', you teleport to a marker 'above'
the city zone, in a room labeled 'Ethereal Caemlyn'.  If you
go in any cardinal direction from there, you enter the actual
world at the respective gate of Caemlyn (w,n,e, or s gate).
I'm gonna do this for all the cities we port over.

a thieves guild entrance for the Caemlyn Black Lions.  Also,
Ranulf showed me a neat way to place small towns on the map
by using enterable objects, that basically act like gates into
other rooms.  We could note a farmhouse or a small village in
the description of a room, and place an enterable object there
called 'A farmhouse' or 'A town gate' or something, and when
you enter it, you enter a large group of rooms that makes the
whole town or whatever - but it only takes up one room on the

`7Subj`6:`7 Dreaming Talent application (long)
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
1) I designed my Wise One (currently apprentice) to be a Dreamer because I wanted to help fill out the Aiel WO ranks with a Dreamer.  I was informed the guild had no current, active Dreamers, and because Dreaming is not as rare a Talent among Aiel, I wanted to help flesh out that aspect of the Wise Ones.  Additionally, I have played every other general type of character: channeler, weapon master, performer, noble, etc.  I have not played a character with the Dreaming Talent previously and wished to explore that avenue of character development.

2) OoCly, I know as much about Tel'ara'rhiod as anyone who has read the series up through Crossraods of Twilight over three dozen times, though somewhat less for the later books.  T'a'r is translated as 'The World of Dreams' or 'The Unseen World,' and it is believed to be of and apart from each potential Weaving of the real world.  Though anyone can 'touch' T'a'r in their sleep, generally it is for only moments and is only remembered as a vivid dream.  One key difference between T'a'r and a personal dreamscape, however, is that T'a'r is an actual place. It -can- be entered into physically, though this is said to be an extremely dangerous undertaking.  (In the books, we see three characters manifest themselves physically into T'a'r with no obvious ill effects, but the warnings against doing so are severe).

Because it is a real place, things that happen there are reflected in the real world, much as dreams themselves are a reflection of life.  Should one be hurt in T'a'r, one would awake with the wounds to show for the damage.  If one dies in the Dream, one does not wake.  It is not a Talent connected inherently to the ability to channel, as Aiel Wise Ones have been able to walk the Dream since time before memory, and not all the Dreamwalkers have been able to channel.

In terms of its reflection to the real world, all permanent objects are seen as they are in the waking world.  Non-permanent objects are ephemeral: doors are open or closed, chairs are pushed in or left out, a bowl may sit on a table and vanish in an instant.  Because these things have no permanent place in the real world, their reflections in T'a'r are inconsistent as well.  Additionally, though a Dreamwalker can be physically affected in T'a'r, the reciprocal statement is invalid.  A Dreamer ripping a door off its hinges in T'a'r would not wake to find the door gone in the real world.

Unlike the waking world, those same ephemeral objects that have no permanent reflection can be manipulated or created by a well-trained Dreamwalker.  Clothing can be whatever one wishes, a pot of steaming tea can appear in one's hands, one's face can look like another's.  The only limitations are those that come of the Dreamer's level of training and control in T'a'r.  A well-trained Dreamer will never find her clothing changing as she moves unless she wishes, while an untrained or poorly trained Dreamer might discover that every breath or errant thought dresses her in new clothing.

As an addition to being able to roam T'a'r, Dreamers can manipulate the realm of dreams in other ways.  They are able to look into other people's regular dreams: a well-trained Dreamer can even interact with the dream of the person they are watching.  Each person's dreams can be located by the Dreamer if she has identified that person's dreams previously.

Some, Aes Sedai and Warders prominent among them, shield their dreams against access from the outside.  Even a talented Dreamwalker cannot enter the dreamscapes of a person with warded dreams.

3) Following is my character's background, approved by acting Guildleader Beonca, for initial explanation of character motivation for obtaining Dreaming.

**At 34, Amra is as atypical in her apprentisheship as she is in her appearance.  Once a weaver married to a trader, her journey toward becoming a Wise One was a surprising one.  Her late husband, Torin, was facing a journey east to the lands of Shara.  The night before his departure on a trip he had made many times, Amra had an excrutiatingly vivid dream.  In the dream, she envisioned her husband being beset by a massive dark swarm and falling dead to the cracked earth.  In the morning she told him of the dream and implored him to take any extra spears he could.  Thinking his normally stolid wife was simply worrying overmuch, he did not heed her request.

Three weeks later, Amra had the same dream and woke with a certainty that her husband had fallen.  When word arrived after another three full weeks that her husband had indeed been killed, along with all the other traders and several algai'd'siswai.  She had told no one of her dreams up to that point, but hearing her fears confirmed, Amra mar

Ok, here's the deal.  I'm back in College Park now, where I
have no internet at my house (which is never a problem since
I'm on campus tons anyways).  BUT recently the university
has decided to get rid of all picture viewing/creating apps
on our lab computers - so I can't open your file.  So, what
I can do is ferry it on disk back to my house, look at it there
and get back to you on it probably tomorrow. :/ I even
tried to have somebody post it on a website for me so I
could view it, and for some reason the email isn't going
thru to them. :p I also can't view it thru IE or Netscape - I'm
about out of ideas, short of just taking it home and coming
back here tomorrow.  Sorry!

`7CC`6: `7Syrah Duren Varulv Beonca 

Maelyn expects to have the final version (I already approved it) of TV posted
by Sunday at the latest, and as soon as it is I'm putting several of the
builders on it to construct it, minus descs.  As soon as it's built, we're
going to insert it where it belongs on the ubermap.  They can continue
to add descs at their leisure, but this way the city will at least be
functional.

I ported over Alindaer and did most of the required renovations (it was
built sideways, courtesy Mikki, who can't read a map).  I'm gonna hook
it, Tar Valon, and the bridges up over the Erinin at the same time,
but Alindaer at least is pretty much good to go, minus some prettying
up.

Syrah, I realized that I didn't port over your Cairhien zones yet, so I
sat down last night and set that up, but I think (hope) I left the files at
hope cuz otherwise I lost them somewhere and they're very gone.
Next chance I get, I'll port them over correctly and you can do whatever
you want to them.

Big picture: These are the major cities that I care about.  Beyond
these, it just comes down to some zones that players particularly
want and use.  Most of those can be added later.  Once we get the
major ones in and done, I'm going to start looking at porting over
the ubermap.

`7CC`6: `7Syrah Duren Varulv Beonca 

Maelyn expects to have the final version (I already approved it) of TV posted
by Sunday at the latest, and as soon as it is I'm putting several of the
builders on it to construct it, minus descs.  As soon as it's built, we're
going to insert it where it belongs on the ubermap.  They can continue
to add descs at their leisure, but this way the city will at least be
functional.

I ported over Alindaer and did most of the required renovations (it was
built sideways, courtesy Mikki, who can't read a map).  I'm gonna hook
it, Tar Valon, and the bridges up over the Erinin at the same time,
but Alindaer at least is pretty much good to go, minus some prettying
up.

Syrah, I realized that I didn't port over your Cairhien zones yet, so I
sat down last night and set that up, but I think (hope) I left the files at
hope cuz otherwise I lost them somewhere and they're very gone.
Next chance I get, I'll port them over correctly and you can do whatever
you want to them.

Big picture: These are the major cities that I care about.  Beyond
these, it just comes down to some zones that players particularly
want and use.  Most of those can be added later.  Once we get the
major ones in and done, I'm going to start looking at porting over
the ubermap.

as you tell me - I just can't remember which place it was that you wanted :p

Also, Tar Valon is going to be posted probably no later than Sunday,

Hey, thanks for adding the 2-way link command - that's

I doing something wrong or are you still working on it? I
was building the maze that conceals the thieves guild
and even when I tell it not to, it still auto-links the exits
where I need 'em mislinked.  Also, it appears to save
the new exits even when you cancel and say 'don't
save'.

Btw, B's gone already, apparently.  I'm not sure if
Kahn ever got her last payment - the last I heard, he
hadn't so I'm not sure if he's expecting payment for

Hey,

I have a couple of ideas for plots. First of all, we should abuse the fact
that if we are both going to make characters that we should make them
either both come from different nations or both have heritage in other
nations, so we can use those heritages for scheming. When we schemed in
Cairhien, we had characters which pretty much limited us to working there.
I think we should be more bold and exciting this time.

For example, I still want to play a Mayener so... I could make a noble that
is of both Mayener and Cairhienin lines. Eg. A Lord Paeron father and a
Damodred mother, or vice-versa. Then you could create a Cairhienin from a
different house and perhaps with noble history in Aringill or maybe even
Andor. That gives us together quite a large tract of land that we can try
and scheme and assert sovreignty over :p

My suggestion is we both try and scheme and help each other to get into
power in different countries and then use each other's power to form a
block against someone, eg. Rand or Morgase (is Morgase Queen of Andor or
do we have a player playing that role? I don't know.)

In terms of how you and I would link together to make us such great plotters
we could have either us 1) Linked by family 2) have some common cause, eg. Rand
or 3) we could be Darkfriends.

TymeRandland is ours!!!! Mahwhaha. :p

What do you think? Let me know so I can start fleshing things out like descs
and BGs.

Ooops. Yeh, and this is Ilusha, i've renamed to this char this will be the
name I use when I start RPing again.

Well, you said you wanted the third zone to be for the inns,

inadvertently made it 202 rooms for the roads and guard towers
instead of the 200 rooms we had orginally counted. So I
readjusted a part of one wall to bring it back to 200, so
it would fit into the two zones we were going to use for that
purpose. It really didn't change the look of the island much.

Is the numbering ok? I wasn't sure how best to do it, so I just
numbered the rooms in a way that made sense to me. But I learned
many years ago that 'sense to Vicki' often means total
chaos to other people.  :)

`7CC`6: `7Varulv Duren 

K, talked to Harkan again and he doesn't think he needs an imm
to assist Eradin on grading, but I told him it was up to the two of
them and he still wants to talk to Era one more time this weekend.
If they decide to imm him, that's what we'll do, otherwise it'll be
a non-imm slot, I don't really care.

Tar Valon is coming along very quickly now - I implemented the
adjusted version of Alindaer (meaning I had to unfuck most of
what Mikki did - and lets coin the word unfuck for fixing things
here :p) onto the BP.  The city is posted for you both to look at (it's
the finalized version) at:
`^http://www.engr.umd.edu/ maeillo/TV_city2_feb_7.bmp`7
I've got the city half-built atm - meaning all of the rooms exist
and about half of them are correctly connected.  The bridges
over the surrounding waterway and the waterway are all correctly
setup.  Basically, after another sitting of connecting exits it'll
be up to the morts to write pretty descs and then it's done.

Varulv, Ranulf asked me about how to get IC info on the people

Ok, looks good and we're good to go.  It's your city so you're in
charge of coordinating the descripting efforts of anybody you
can get to help - I'd ask Nenae, Phaedra and Quinlan for
starters - they've all worked on the ubermap - and maybe
Bethany as well (she's been bored during the day).  Here's
where we're at:

I constructed all of zone 90 and 91 (all numbered rooms on
your map) - the city should be fully working except for the
missing tower and the missing descs.  It's connected to
the bridges, which connect to the ubermap.  I also redid
Alindaer (a half assed job but it's ok), and imported it as
well - the bridge to Alindaer connects to your city like it
should.  The other bridges just pop out at the squares on
the ubermap where the towns would go (see the website:)
`^http://www.engr.umd.edu/ maeillo/index2.htm`7  and
`^http://www.engr.umd.edu/ maeillo/TV_city2_feb_7.bmp`7

Please come up with a color scheme for the city, and use it
in the title of the red rooms on your map.  Like `3T`#a`2r V`2a`#lo`3n`7
or something, but pretty :p All the cities have all their gates
marked that way, and each city has its own color scheme.
Lemme know what it is, cuz we'll have references to it outside
the city, as well.  Up to you what colors you want :>

If you find any mistakes, lemme know.  I may have to do some
additional pfile setting for everybody to be able to edit the city,
but I can't remember everybody's BP names offhand so just
let me know or get another imm to set you.  I can do it offline
if you send me a list of names, too.

There is one mistake that I fixed - but just so you know, the way
it's built right now is correct, so don't change it :p On your map,
there are two adjacent rooms numbered 9084 - the one of the
right is now 9011, since there is no 9011 anywhere else.  There
is another 9085 tho, so I kept it where it was and just recycled
9011.  It should be right.

I adjusted the 'goto tv' and 'goto al' (alindaer) markers.  Alindaer
works exactly like caemlyn's does, and tv just pops you out at
in the yellow squares on your map.

Besides just the city itself, the river around the city also needs
to be descripted, as do the bridges and the one-room villages
around the city.  They can stay one room for now, but they do
need a desc and the name from the books.

You can do all new descs if you so desire, but you can also
pirate some of the current TV ones if you like.  Ranulf mentioned
the Silver Swan (never looked at it), but it'd be cool if you could
reconstruct it as one of the inns as well, since there's a couple
people that RP there on the main port.  Also, start deciding how
to use the white tower - if you want to just slap it as is in the
middle of the city, or if we need to adjust it, or what.  It's your
guild area and your call what you want to do with it.

Umm.  I think that's it.  I'll be around off and on for large chunks
of time to help, but mailing me is fastest.  Feel free to beep me
if you guys need anything. :> Have fun, and thanks :)

Hey, I tried to mudmail you on the builderport, but everytime I

Anyway, the reason I was mailing is I don't have permission

In the meantime, if anyone is bored, here is a little info to get 
you started on the descriptions:

Color code is white and cyan. Ex  `&T`6a`7r `&V`6al`7on
My suggestion is to name the roads by the bridge/harbor they lead to (ie 
`&Al`6in`7da`&er R`6oa`7d, `&No`6rt`7hha`7rb`&or R`6oa`7d, etc). Some adjustment may need to be made to that,
but for now that should help us keep it straight. The road that connects them all and circles 
the island is simply `&T`6a`7r `&V`6al`7on `&W`6a`7y.
Ill get started as soon as Jake gets the permissions set for me. 
Thanks for all your help! I truly appreciate it!

`7From`6:`7 Alzer
`7Subj`6:`7 Background
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Alzer was born in a farming village in Arafel called Tifan's Well.  His mother lived and worked in the town as a seamstress.  She was a strong and kind woman.  His father fell in battle before he was born and so, Alzer never saw him.  Even from when Alzer was very little, his life was dominated by thoughts of fighting at the Blight, and he learned, as any child in the borderlands does, about their nations greatest single enemy.  While Tifan's Well, being more to the south of Arafel, was safer than villages of the north, the threat was still real, reports of raids coming all the time.
Like most young men in the borderlands, Alzer was taught rudimentary warcraft.  At age 11 he went north to train with Lord Kaslar and was given a place to stay at his fort near the Blightborder.  Amongst other youths, Alzer was one of the few to show fast learning and extraordinary skill.  He was dedicated to his cause -training to be able to fight at the Blightborder and defend his nation, and when he was deemed old enough, he put his hair in braids and went northwards.
When Alzer  fought Trollocs for the first time, his assignment by his Lord, was to investigate a village that had gone silent one month prior.  It was the middle of Winter and the snow was a trouble to get through in order to reach the location.  What Alzer and the men with him found was only the burned remains of buildings and of people, and soon after they had arrived, they were attacked by not only trollocs, but a fair few fades as well.  Luckily the borderlanders outnumbered the Shadow's forces and they were defeated but Alzer will never forget that first look that he got of the eyeless which froze him to the spot with fear.  
Since that event, Alzer has helped fight off many Trolloc raids into Arafel, but the Blight takes more and more of Arafel's territory every year.  With news of the Dragon Reborn appearing in the southlands, Alzer and the few men now under his command rejoiced.  Others were skeptical, yet many felt hope that the Light may finally have delivered the man to them.  At first, hearing the news of the Amnesty for male channelers in Andor, Alzer was appalled, but if the Dragon Reborn is training them for battle against the Shadow, such power would give the forces of the Light at Tarmon Gaidon a great advantage and he sees this.  If he can learn, he would be willing to.  At the moment, Alzer is back at his home village of Tifan's Well visiting his family with the chance he has been given, now that the Blight has grown suspiciously quiet.  He is remaining in the borderlands at the moment in case the armies of the Shadow are building up for a large attack, which is his suspicion.

Stupid Mud mail. Sorry, i've had a bit of trouble sending this so I don't know what you recieved.

You glance around your gaze falling upon her, her ice blue eyes shimmering softly.
On the right side of her beautiful face there appears to be an odd red design painted 
on, covering most of it. Her long dark brown hair hangs down her back in an intricate
braid that reaches slightly past her waist. She wears a tight black coat embroidered 
in silver. Under the coat she wears a loose white blouse tucked into her tight fitting 
black leather pants.  Her black boots come up over her pant legs and end just
below her kness. A black leather strap trimmed in silver hangs over her shoulder 
and across her chest. The strap connects to a long slightly curved black leather 
scabbard trimmed in silver, on her back. A foot long hilt extends from the scabbard
up over her shoulder, the hilt and cross guard are wrapped in black leather strips. 
Well crafted silver work can be seen from beneath the leather strips, on the pommel, 
and over the cross guard. On her right forearm is a black steel parrying bracer also
wrapped in black leather strips with a small bit of silver work showing inbetween the
strips. Worn on the ring finger of her right hand is an odd ring of silver which appears
to be a dozen serpents entwined together with small emeralds inset for their eyes,

Christa was born into house Damodred about twenty years ago. Her father was a 
minor noble of the house and her mother was a noble of a smaller house, House Kaer. 
She grew up with two older brothers a three or four off from her own age. Her mother 
died from natural causes during child birth with her. Having no real female role-model 
she turned out to be a tom boy. Her nurse tried her best to keep her in dresses and 
teach her the things she would need to be a lady in Cairhien. She excelled in her 
studies be it history, court intrigue, or anything else. Only having to be shown or told 
something once she would remember it without any problem. As a child she was found 
more often out playing with her brothers and the other boys well they practice the sword, 
which is where she learned what skill she has, then with anyone her own age or sex. 
Often causing trouble or playing pranks, she was a mischievious child. At about the age 
of eighteen her father arranged for her to marry. In secret she hired a blacksmith to make 
her the sword and bracer she now carries and a silver smith to do the silver work on bracer 
and sword. After the completion she gathered a few belongings, changes of clothes and 
her mothers ring, and some coin. She ran away to become a Hunter for the Horn. Traveling 
to Illian to take the oaths. She reached Illian in time to take the oaths using her mothers 
maiden name she traveled far and wide searching for the horn to no avail ending up in the 
Two Rivers area during the time when the Trollocs attacked(the second time). She came 
across a lone trolloc who attacked her. She was saved when a young Two Rivers boy put 
an arrow through the beast. Realizing her own in-ability to protect her self she set off for the 
Tower in Tar Valon to learn from the warders. Her only goal, next to that of finding the Horn, 
to become a blade master.
going on at the time. Some I would like to try to reestablish even with the lack of the players 
from then. She was a distinguished Hunter for the Horn and had recieved training from two 
warders/blade masters from the tower. One was the Aiel blade master Tarkan(sp?). The other 
I can no longer remember his name after so long. She had also been inducted into the 
Companions of Illian by Lord Brend/Sammael himself unknowing that he was one of the 
forsaken. She had considerable training from the two warders in emote fighting. As well as I 
have had years of experience emote fighting before even coming to A Moment in Tyme on 
Prodigy's RP chat. If you need any other information just e-mail me back I will do what I can. 
The background is fairly rough I wrote it in about a half an hour so it may need a little work.

We're looking for an old Gleeman book from March 2003.  It's an object Cormac
built in OLC.  It was in zone 8, but zone 8 no longer seems to exist, and I
can't find this object in any other zones.  Did we wipe out some zone files
with the ubermap?  Do we have backups?

Hey Nico, two requests for you:

1) Port zone one from the BP over here.  Boris needs his Imm room (and Varulv and I need our voodoo doll)

2) I don't know if you remember what you told Gavriela when she was granted the Foretelling ability, but
she took it upon herself to decide what is an appropriate foretelling, screwed it up, and caused Varulv and
I to null it.  She is asking for 'detailed' instructions on what she can and cannot do, so if you can please
help us out with this, I'd appreciate it.  If you send her something, send it to V and I as well, so we are
aware of what's going on with her.  If you want details of just what she did, please feel free to ask V or
myself.

Thanks!

Hey, sorry I didn't reply back sooner but I haven't had time to
go through my mail til now.  If Gav's is doing her own foretellings,
feel free to slap her down.  She knows she needs to get her
foretellings approved by the IC Imp (me back when she started,
and now it's Varulv), and she damned well knows it.  Do whatever
you need to - I'm prepared to tell her to fuck the hell off if she
complains to me about it.  The 'detailed' instructions on what
she's allowed to do are up to V, entirely.  Her policy with me
was that she would receive her foretellings from me, not make
them up herself.  If she needed something, she'd come to me
to get it.

Syrah, far as the importing zone 1 goes - I can't until valgrind
goes off.  Til we enable the 'real' mud, none of that stuff shows
up here - only the small list of old zones are active.  That's
why the new houses aren't showing up, even tho they're technically
there.  Soon as Duren is done with Valgrind we'll put them
in.

Sorry 'bout that.

`7Subj`6:`7 Damiel BG and Desc:
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Background:

   Born in 973 N.E., Damiel Tesarin was the son of a Kandori merchant
and his Amadician wife.  They met and fell in love in the spring of 973,
and in the middle of that year's Borderland winter Damiel was born.  
Unfortunately, the child knew his father only for a few months before
the elder Tesarin was killed in a fall from his horse.  His mother was
left both grief stricken and bereft of any means of support for herself 
and her child.  She sent Damiel south to live in Amador with his 
grandfather, an aging and strict Child of the Light.  He was raised from 
the cradle following the Children's tenets, his grandfather being of the
old guard of Children, those who encouraged the spirit of Mantellar's
words in pursuing a life of virtue, self-denial, and justice.  The boy
had a keen sense of right and wrong, and was honest to a fault.  At the
age of sixteen he was entered into the Children of the Light and
instructed in the ways of soldiery.  He took to this aptly, probably
because of his height and formidable build, but in comparison to other
recruits he was not eager to fight.  Once his basic training was
complete, he was sent to serve in a legion stationed in Andor.  Through 
the years of his service, he distinguished himself enough to earn 
several promotions through displays of good character judgement, a 
discerning eye, and a rigorous commitment to the Children's tenets, but 
never became an officer.  This was likely because of his reluctance to 
fight and view of violence as a last resort, the Children at this point
being a largely military organization.

Description:

   A tall young man, with a deep chest and shoulders that belong on a 
blacksmith: he is a Child of the Light.  Golden curls frame his face, 
and his eyes are like cold blue stones.  His cheeks are clean shaven,
and his uniform resplendent.  Everything about him attests to a life of 
order and discipline.  A snowy white cloak swathes him from shoulders to 
ankles, its voluminous hood thrown back.  A flaring sunburst is stitched 
upon its left breast in thread of gold.  His back and breastplates are 
unadorned, smooth steel designed to turn away an enemy's weapon, but 
they shine like silver when struck by the light.  Gleaming mail covers 
his arms and legs, and his black leather boots are both meticulously 
clean and polished to a dull shine.  Soft gauntlets of black leather 
protect his hands, and a golden-buckled belt encircles his waist.  A 
two-handed broadsword is slung across his back.  Its thick, tapered 
steel blade is housed in a scabbard of gold worked black leather, its
pommel is a golden sunburst, and the slightly curved quillions bear 
lethal points.

Hi,

Just a quick note to let you know that I didn't intentionally
disappear in the middle of the conversation. My cable connection has
been screwy lately, and I got disconnected. I needed to go to work,
and couldn't get back.  I'd like to know what was resolved, if anythng.

Thanks,

I was able to reliably crash the MUD this morning, by being stuck in an endless loop
of the editor.  If I disconnected and reconnected, this problem didn't occur.  If I logged
off and then relogged, it did.
I suspect that the error was located in nanny.c by not cleaning up the editting buffer
when I reconnected, versus when I simply connected normally.  The edit buffer cleanup is 
probably located AFTER the "perform_dupe_check" function - that would be my supposition.

In either case, if I tried to save the message, the MUD immediately crashed
Somehow by typing @l enough with Varulvs help, eventually I got a message that said,
"Line too long, last line skipped" and it kicked me out of the editor.

`7Name: Rasequin Longaard.
`7
`7Gender: Male
`7
`7Age: 28
`7
`7Origin: Arafel
`7
`7Height: 6'2"
`7
`7Weight: 210 pounds
`7
`7Hair: Jet Black (with bells)
`7
`7Eyes: Light Blue
`7
`7Physical Appearance: Tall and athletic.
`7
`7Weapons of choice: Bastard Swords
`7
`7Bio: Rasequin was born to a rich family, given the luxuries that came with being rich from birth to his teen years.  `7Enducation was nothing but the best, and his classes included both mental and physical, including sword skills taught to `7every borderland child.
`7
`7His parents were rich because they were close friends to royal members of the royal houses of Arafel, as well as owning a `7lucrative business in service trading.
`7
`7Rasequin would have had a share in this business.  With the education he gained, and his good relationship with his father, `7he would have become a partner and shared in the wealth.
`7
`7During his twenty-first year, it began.  Signs of a channeling nature.  His ability to channel was not so obvious, even to `7himself.  What he knew of channeling already was almost none-existant, and to link it to his own problems would be madness.  `7At first, he could only explain such things like glasses falling from tables as he passed as a coincident.  He would grasp, `7but it would raise the bile from his stomach each time, and each grasp was never one that was meant to happen.  He could not `7grasp at will, nor stop himself when he had.
`7
`7By the age of twenty-Three, his father had offered him a part in the business.  This, he took up straight away.  Soon, his `7talent didn't just come and go now and then, like before.  Now it was getting worst, and almost bad enough for his family to `7see.  It was beginning to control him.  Each time he grasped, it threatened to over run him, and burn him to a crisp, yet `7everytime he did grasp, he only wanted to do it again, and again.  He learned from his lessons of sword fighting, the use of `7Oneness would help him grasp manually, and help with the taint that always twisted his stomach.
`7
`7At the age of Twenty-Six, now three years a knowing channeler, has since learned technics such as weaving.  The ability to `7grasp and release soon became a simple proceedure.  What he thought was a fast rate of learning, was soon discovered to be a `7slow one.
`7
`7Rasequin left home, as part of his business, to expand, and to work in foreign countries.  He would eventually stay in `7Caemlyn, where fate led him into the Asha'man's hands.  His training began, and he did not refuse it, instead, was more than `7willing to learn as much as he possibly could.
`7
`7Just turned twenty-eight, Rasequin's father died.  It was an illness, unknown, but terminal.  The illness struck swiftly, `7starting as a simple cold, then a fever, and finally the stopping of one's beating heart.  It could only be described as his `7time to depart from the world.  Poor health in recent years, resulting in a fast deteriation of the defence mechanisms that `7the body creates.
`7
`7Saddened by the news, all profits were now Rasequin's.  Upon the duties to the Asha'man, he was determined to continue on `7the business his father started, but both seem a task and a half, and often Rasequin could be found to be struggling.
`7
`7Rasequin joined the Aldazar talon when he had the choice.  This seemed most suited.  He could use his business as a front, `7be an Asha'man, and remain almost indefinitely out of uniform.  The perfect spy.

`7Rasequin left home, as part of his business, to expand, and to work in foreign countries.  He would eventually stay in Caemlyn, where fate led him into the Asha'man's hands.  His training began about the age of twenty-six, and he did not refuse it, instead, was more than willing to learn as much as he possibly could.
`7
`7Just turned twenty-eight, Rasequin's father died.  It was an illness, unknown, but terminal.  The illness struck swiftly, starting as a simple cold, then a fever, and finally the stopping of one's beating heart.  It could only be described as his time to depart from the world.  Poor health in recent years, resulting in a fast deteriation of the defence mechanisms that the body creates.
`7
`7Saddened by the news, all profits were now Rasequin's.  Upon the duties to the Asha'man, he was determined to continue on the business his father started, but both seem a task and a half, and often Rasequin could be found to be struggling.
`7
`7Rasequin joined the Aldazar talon when he had the choice.  This seemed most suited.  He could use his business as a front, be an Asha'man, and remain almost indefinitely out of uniform.  The perfect spy.

`7Name: Rasequin Longaard.

`7Gender: Male
`7
`7Age: 28
`7
`7Origin: Arafel

`7Weapons of choice: Bastard Swords
`7
`7Bio: Rasequin was born to a rich family, given the luxuries that came with being rich from birth to his teen years.  Enducation was nothing but the best, and his classes included both mental and physical, including sword skills taught to every borderland child.
`7
`7His parents were rich because they were close friends to royal members of the royal houses of Arafel, as well as owning a lucrative business in service trading.
`7
`7Rasequin would have had a share in this business.  With the education he gained, and his good relationship with his father, he would have become a partner and shared in the wealth. 
`7
`7He now worked for his fathers company, learning the ins and outs of the business, and it would eventually lead to brighter things.  It was about the age of twenty-five that he showed signs of a channeling nature.  His ability to channel was not so obvious, even to himself.  What he knew of channeling already was almost none-existant, and to link it to his own problems would be madness.  At first, he could only explain such things like glasses falling from tables as he passed as a coincident.  He would grasp, but it would raise the bile from his stomach each time, and each grasp was never one that was meant to happen.  He could not grasp at will, nor stop himself when he had.  Only luck kept him clean under his fathers watchful eye.
`7
`7By the age of twenty-six, his father had offered him a part in the business.  This, he took up straight away.  Soon, his talent didn't just come and go now and then, like before.  Now it was getting worst, and almost bad enough for his family to see.  It was beginning to control him.  Each time he grasped, it threatened to over run him, and burn him to a crisp, yet everytime he did grasp, he only wanted to do it again, and again.  He learned from his lessons of sword fighting, the use of Oneness would help him grasp manually, and help with the taint that always twisted his stomach.

Hey chika. :)
Gavriela and Sayid have asked for a Blightborder quest to get some
IC experience fighting shadowspawn. If you happen to see both of them
on, feel free to run the quest... just toss 10-20 trollocs at them and
let them do whatever, treat it as a minor scouting party along the 
'civilized' border. If they choose to go too deep into the blight,
chuck one of the nasty worms at them and make 'em scream like little
girls. Or whatever. I trust you to do what you think is right. Don't
really try to kill them unless they're being stupid, that sort of thing.
If you do run it, make sure to log it and send it to me:
shadowenfold@yahoo.com
If you don't run it, no worries.

And as a quick P.S. Syrah says they aren't allowed to link during it.
*hugs* laters!

`7Subj`6:`7 Vitor's Soldier test
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Under the bright, intese heat of the noonday sun, still there are plenty of black coated men practicing alone or in groups all over the yards, the ranking Asha'man giving quiet and sometimes not so quiet instruction as they move among the less experienced men they're training.  Some practice alone, however, Vitor being one of these.  Near the practice yard's southeast corner, he is holding the full rush of saidin's stomach turning flow that he can manage.  He seems to be experimenting with something.  Kneeling to pound a fist on the ground, he sends a braided cord of Fire and Earth into it which dives deep beneath the ground's surface before coming back up some four paces away in a straight line in front of him.  However, it has little effect, only a bit of hot mud and rock gurgling up from the ground.  He frowns and lets the weave vanish, straightening up.  [Vitor]

Jude strides up behind Vitor, his quarterstaff giving his pace an thunking rhythm.  He watches the Recruit attempting his weave for a moment and snorts in derision.  Whether he turns around or not, the old Murandian addresses him sharply. "Recruit, release and follow me."  Fully expecting his command to be obeyed, he turns and walks to a cleared area of the yard where an 'X' has been burned into the ground.  He stands on it and indicates another some fifteen feet away.  "You stand there."  He waits until Vitor has complied before proceeding.

His Power enhanced hearing picking up the sound of Jude's approach even in the none too quiet practice yard, Vitor turns around and salutes with his hand over his heart, his feet coming together as he stands at attention.  Not bothering to waste time with questions, he simply does as Jude commands and falls in behind the older man to follow him over to the marked sparring area.  He nods and moves to the second X, stands over it, and turns to square off against his opponent, saidin as yet remaining out of his reach but the Void lending a cold spark to his eyes.  Setting his feet, he spreads his hands back and opens his shoulders to the warmth the sun casts down on his back, putting himself on the brink of grasping the Source.  [Vitor]

Jude regards Vitor silently for a moment, assessing him and then snickers.  His gravely voice rings out over the yard to cover the distance, and even as he speaks he summons the Void and grasps Saidin, his face contorting into a barely restrained snarl as life and death engage in their delicated dance within his veins.  "Defend yourself!"  Without pausing and drawing only half as much as he is able, he channels a bar of solid Air strengthened with Earth.  He sends it forward quickly, like a tripwire aimed at Vitor's ankles.  Another one quickly follows at the Andoran's knee level, and then a third at the same height as his stomach.  Each is about two feet behind the one that proceeded it, and each is strong and fast enough to knock the Recruit down if he doesn't properly defend himself.

Vitor's fingers curl forward slowly, belying the the eagerness with which he leaps towards the Power.  Saidin rushes into him - a negligible amount compared to what Jude holds even at half his capacity, but it is all that Vitor can control.  He weaves a simple defense, sending a thick flow of Earth down into the ground at is feet.  It rears up in respose, forming a foot thick wall that rushes to Vitor's full height and completely blocks him from few as the three bars thud into its surface, shaking loose dust and rock and leaving a series of imprints.  It crumbles away to dust all at once as soon as Vitor is through with it, and the drifting motes it leaves behind glitter in the reflected red light of the fist sized ball of fire he creates, weaving Fire and Air, and then hurls swiftly in a straight line for Jude's chest.

Jude gives a tight and unpleasant smile at Vitor's first defense, but it turns to an irritated frown at the tiny fireball streaking towards him.  He weaves a small shield of Air, blocking the attack and he too lets his defense dissipate as soon as he is done with it.  His counterattack is nearly the opposite of the Recruit's.  He channels Air and Water in a cone about three feet above his opponent's head.  The tip is pointed at the top of Vitor's skull, and as the last flows fall into place, the weave draws moisture out of the air to fill the cone, and the Air freezes it instantly before it drops.  The sharp icicle is about two feet in diameter at its base and about three feet long.  If Vitor doesn't move or destroy it, it will crush down throught the top of his skull and kill him.

`7Subj`6:`7 Vitor's Soldier test
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Under the bright, intese heat of the noonday sun, still there are plenty of black coated men practicing alone or in groups all over the yards, the ranking Asha'man giving quiet and sometimes not so quiet instruction as they move among the less experienced men they're training.  Some practice alone, however, Vitor being one of these.  Near the practice yard's southeast corner, he is holding the full rush of saidin's stomach turning flow that he can manage.  He seems to be experimenting with something.  Kneeling to pound a fist on the ground, he sends a braided cord of Fire and Earth into it which dives deep beneath the ground's surface before coming back up some four paces away in a straight line in front of him.  However, it has little effect, only a bit of hot mud and rock gurgling up from the ground.  He frowns and lets the weave vanish, straightening up.  [Vitor]

Jude strides up behind Vitor, his quarterstaff giving his pace an thunking rhythm.  He watches the Recruit attempting his weave for a moment and snorts in derision.  Whether he turns around or not, the old Murandian addresses him sharply. "Recruit, release and follow me."  Fully expecting his command to be obeyed, he turns and walks to a cleared area of the yard where an 'X' has been burned into the ground.  He stands on it and indicates another some fifteen feet away.  "You stand there."  He waits until Vitor has complied before proceeding.

His Power enhanced hearing picking up the sound of Jude's approach even in the none too quiet practice yard, Vitor turns around and salutes with his hand over his heart, his feet coming together as he stands at attention.  Not bothering to waste time with questions, he simply does as Jude commands and falls in behind the older man to follow him over to the marked sparring area.  He nods and moves to the second X, stands over it, and turns to square off against his opponent, saidin as yet remaining out of his reach but the Void lending a cold spark to his eyes.  Setting his feet, he spreads his hands back and opens his shoulders to the warmth the sun casts down on his back, putting himself on the brink of grasping the Source.  [Vitor]

Jude regards Vitor silently for a moment, assessing him and then snickers.  His gravely voice rings out over the yard to cover the distance, and even as he speaks he summons the Void and grasps Saidin, his face contorting into a barely restrained snarl as life and death engage in their delicated dance within his veins.  "Defend yourself!"  Without pausing and drawing only half as much as he is able, he channels a bar of solid Air strengthened with Earth.  He sends it forward quickly, like a tripwire aimed at Vitor's ankles.  Another one quickly follows at the Andoran's knee level, and then a third at the same height as his stomach.  Each is about two feet behind the one that proceeded it, and each is strong and fast enough to knock the Recruit down if he doesn't properly defend himself.

Vitor's fingers curl forward slowly, belying the the eagerness with which he leaps towards the Power.  Saidin rushes into him - a negligible amount compared to what Jude holds even at half his capacity, but it is all that Vitor can control.  He weaves a simple defense, sending a thick flow of Earth down into the ground at is feet.  It rears up in respose, forming a foot thick wall that rushes to Vitor's full height and completely blocks him from few as the three bars thud into its surface, shaking loose dust and rock and leaving a series of imprints.  It crumbles away to dust all at once as soon as Vitor is through with it, and the drifting motes it leaves behind glitter in the reflected red light of the fist sized ball of fire he creates, weaving Fire and Air, and then hurls swiftly in a straight line for Jude's chest.

As yet, I've been unable to duplicate the original

into the editor.  
That said, the real 'bug' came in the form of my inability
to log in.  Since my editor buffer was bugged, during
my state CON_RECONNECT or the equivellent it was dumping
me right back into the editor.  It told me, "When we rebooted,
you were in an editor.  Trying to recover."  No matter what I did,
the mud would crash.  I had to force-dc, and then I could come

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Thank you for sending me such a complete and wonderfully
written background!  It's much easier to understand in
that format, rather than the bits and pieces I had been
receiving from you previously.

However, there is one thing missing that you have, in the
past, mentioned which is now no longer in the picture,
and I think it made an excellent explanation as to why
you went missing, and why Ranulf became High Seat. That
was the part where you claim that you were stabbed and
presumed dead.  I would like you to keep that part in the
story, because then it will be easier to make connections.
If you keep that in your background, I will approve it,
and you will be allowed to roleplay as a noble and gain
your sponsors.   You will be able to roleplay toward the
restoration of your House, and you may attempt to ICly
take the High Seat from Ranulf.

So, that's the only change you need to make.

Beyond that, you still need to get your seeking score
into the positive range before I can guild you. However,
once your background is approved, you'll be able to roleplay
again, and gain your sponsors.

Well, WoW owns the remnants of my social life, so take that as a review. *grin* It's really good, aimed for the casual player, although it has a lot of depth as well. Lots of very different characters, vast world, well done fighting system, balanced classes (after the last patch, at least).

I play on lots of places, but lately I really enjoy the Scarlet Crusade server - basically, it's a RP server. Yeah. I know. But they try - in fact, they can be more elitist at times since there are that many more morons and 1337 kids around, so people who can type and spell at once get all defensive about it. :p I have Horde alts there, although on RP servers you can have characters on both factions (unlike PvP servers, where you are restricted to one side only).

PvP is also fun. I like the tension of walking in some forest and never knowing when some idiot 23887 levels higher will attack and destroy you. Woo! :p They are also making Battlegrounds for (probably) the next patch, which is like a purely PvP zone with capture the flag, etc events that can land you bonuses and special eq and the such.

That's all! As for school, hmm. I wish I could go back to one. But a) it tends to not pay :p and b) I haaaate exams. Actually, I taught for a while, but man that's hard! You can't slack off, these people are WATCHING you, hungry, waiting to pounce, eager to see you make a mistake. It's scary. :(

Well, depends on the character. Basically, it's a game aimed at casual players - two months
at the most and you can easily cap out at lvl 60 if you play just one class. If you are like me, and you get a new alt every time you see something you like (oooh! he can shoot pretty lights!!11) then you might take a bit more. :)

The whole thing is getting what you want. At first I loved PvP, but you tend to get somewhat lower average IQs surrounding you. :p However there is a bigger thrill in everything, since after the newbie zones every time you walk around you can be attacked on sight. I kinda like RP servers also, because then when you _are_ level 60, you still have something to do than run a top level dungeon for the 61th time trying to get a helmet that's gonna make you a little bit tougher.

It's hack'n'slash, yeah. :p But there are also professions and stuff. Some are gathering, some are making (so they compliment each other), and some are just weird (like engineering, you can make bombs, etc - TERRORIST!!!11). The graphics are awesome, of course, and the style is quirky in WC fashion - I love Tauren, myself. Although when the roof is low all you can see is your own @$$!

Hey guys, I need to talk to you about the IC location of
the Black Tower.  We're placing everybody's guild areas
where they belong IC - the seafolk area is now a ship that
sails up the Erinin and into the ocean, the Aiel are getting
the waste back, etc.  How do you want to do your area, and
where do you want it? We can keep your existing guild area
and splice it into the map if you like, or we can modify it
or even make a new one if you prefer.  If you would, mail
me back with your preliminary thoughts and we'll discuss it
from there.  The ubermap is moving along pretty fast now and
I'm starting to anticipate bringing it over to the main port,
but I'd like to include all the major areas that belong in
this section now so it all goes live at the same time.

Thanks! Hit me back.

Hey, I've got Leara and I think it was Vivianne descripting the

Vivianne is doing the zone around Cairhien).  Also, Rasequin
made up a roadmap of what he thought we could do for
Shadar Logoth, posted at:
`^http://www.lenncraft.co.uk/shadarlogoth.gif`7

He showed it to me this afternoon, I liked it, so we went
ahead and built the whole thing (zones 48 and 49).  Yeah,
we're impulsive and efficient :p Anyway, the idea is that
it stresses streets since most of the buildings are collapsed
and all are abandoned - I've run through it quite a few times,
and it comes off a lot like the old SL but nicer.  He's gonna
have a few major buildings, and I'm gonna screw with
some mislinkings and enterable objects to create some
additional tricks.   Oh, and his builder is Aled.

Think that's it for the moment.

I went ahead and created the rooms for both tower

of 10x10 room dimensions.  I went ahead and made
all 200 rooms for the two zones that way - obviously
some of the ones we'll have to switch to outdoors
but since I was aliasing it was easier to make them
all the same for now.

I'm looking at the layout stuff you sent again - I
really like it, especially the grounds map (and the
bridge).  I'm still trying to decide how to map out
the ajah floors - I think I'm going to take that home
and work it out this evening.  I think when we said
we'd probably need to add a couple more hallway
rooms to those floors, we were right, but I can't
quite decide how many to add.  Anywho. :p

to be fixed so they don't connect to the ones next to them. Room 46880 and 46896
are two RP spots and I was hoping we could maybe put a minor RPEXP flag in her,
but I don't know how to do that.

I tried to stay consistant with room names and colors. And I know I repeated alot
of rooms, but it will be easier to change it or add to it with something there.
I think I did about 35 rooms, all in the southwest. Could you go over them and see
if I made any mistakes?

Anyway, Im sleepy, see you tommorrow!!

Yikes, ok, breaking it down:
Mail doesn't work on the BP - it can crash it if you try and
check your mail there, too, so be careful :p

The bridge is right - it's vnum 4`^8`7618, not 46818.  Basically
the room in your zone is the river, and the other zone is where
the bridge itself is coming from.  They're spliced together.  I
need to give you authorization to edit the bridge zone, too.

RP bonuses are done in game :>

I agree with the river/road exits - there are long stretches
where I'm gonna purge exits along rivers.  I'll do that later
on though, since doing it now is just gonna make it harder
to cruise through the zone to error check.

I like your color rooms - the Fields of Grass and Quaint
Farmland are real cool, and so's the Stand of Trees.
I found two typos and fixed 'em - mostly everything looks
really, really good.  Keep it up, and thanks :>

M'Haels,

Following up on the encounter with the Shadowspawn in the Queen's Blessing, I contacted several
people in Caemlyn to find out what I could.  The Warder who first warned us of the Shadowspawn
evidently has some connections with the Queen's Guard, because he was able to tell me that the
youth the Trollocs chased into the Blessing was indeed involved with the beasts.  Apparently, the
wounded man attempted to turn the youth to the Dark, and when he refused, the Shadowspawn attacked
him.  By the boy's words, the Darkfriend defended him, and the Shadowspawn chased the pair of
them into the city and finally into the Blessing.  The youth stated that the Shadowspawn had been
camped to the Southwest of Caemlyn.  While this information does come from the lips of a lap-dog,
they do seem to fit with the events I saw.  With independent confirmation, this could be very
useful information.

Additionally, I heard from a woodswoman named Elaena Farshere, who looked like <desc Elaena>,
that plants in the north-east section of Braem Wood are beginning to show up that are best
described as "something out of the Blight."  She gave me relatively detailed directions to the
area where these plants are spreading, and warned me that normal blades do not seem to cut them,
and that they seem to spread by floating spores which are dangerous to inhale.  While I do not
know if this report is connected to the previous one, it seems clear that the Shadow is closing
in around Caemlyn.

Hey all, those of us still at school are between semesters atm
so Duren and I are taking advantage of this time to get as
much done as humanly possible on MM3.2.  This includes
all the major projects, most especially combat.  I want to
get the ubermap online as well, and I'll be logging on to spam-
desc zones whenever I can get into a lab.  If there's anything
you've been asked to do or know you can contribute to,
please weigh in.  These work-icide sessions of ours only
come around about twice a year, and it's important that we
get as much done as we can so that we can get the mud
running for real.

Since the labs are generally locked right now, I'm going
to be doing my own work at home and then when I can
get online I'm gonna bust it out as fast as possible.  I
won't be on all day, but I will be working LOTS.  Please
throw in whatever time you can spare as well.  It's important!

Things to do:
Ubermap: Most especially finishing Tar Valon proper, the
white tower, and the remaining countryside zones.

Combat: All aspects, highest priority.

Channeling: Hale and I still need a large list of all the
weaves and all the things you guys want them to do.  We've
got several partial lists, but I really want a 'This is all we
ever want to see' list of weaves and affects.

RP: Get some RP plots going again.  This place is looking
dead.  Events and fun quests (OOC or IC) would hit the spot
if you can get enough people on.

Everybody else: Find something to do.  I want every imm and
staff member to contribute - whatever way you want or can is
fine.  This is a team effort and we need everybody on board.

Hey all, those of us still at school are between semesters atm
so Duren and I are taking advantage of this time to get as
much done as humanly possible on MM3.2.  This includes
all the major projects, most especially combat.  I want to
get the ubermap online as well, and I'll be logging on to spam-
desc zones whenever I can get into a lab.  If there's anything
you've been asked to do or know you can contribute to,
please weigh in.  These work-icide sessions of ours only
come around about twice a year, and it's important that we
get as much done as we can so that we can get the mud
running for real.

Since the labs are generally locked right now, I'm going
to be doing my own work at home and then when I can
get online I'm gonna bust it out as fast as possible.  I
won't be on all day, but I will be working LOTS.  Please
throw in whatever time you can spare as well.  It's important!

Things to do:
Ubermap: Most especially finishing Tar Valon proper, the
white tower, and the remaining countryside zones.

Combat: All aspects, highest priority.

Channeling: Hale and I still need a large list of all the
weaves and all the things you guys want them to do.  We've
got several partial lists, but I really want a 'This is all we
ever want to see' list of weaves and affects.

RP: Get some RP plots going again.  This place is looking
dead.  Events and fun quests (OOC or IC) would hit the spot
if you can get enough people on.

Everybody else: Find something to do.  I want every imm and
staff member to contribute - whatever way you want or can is
fine.  This is a team effort and we need everybody on board.

Hey all, those of us still at school are between semesters atm
so Duren and I are taking advantage of this time to get as
much done as humanly possible on MM3.2.  This includes
all the major projects, most especially combat.  I want to
get the ubermap online as well, and I'll be logging on to spam-
desc zones whenever I can get into a lab.  If there's anything
you've been asked to do or know you can contribute to,
please weigh in.  These work-icide sessions of ours only
come around about twice a year, and it's important that we
get as much done as we can so that we can get the mud
running for real.

Since the labs are generally locked right now, I'm going
to be doing my own work at home and then when I can
get online I'm gonna bust it out as fast as possible.  I
won't be on all day, but I will be working LOTS.  Please
throw in whatever time you can spare as well.  It's important!

Things to do:
Ubermap: Most especially finishing Tar Valon proper, the
white tower, and the remaining countryside zones.

Combat: All aspects, highest priority.

Channeling: Hale and I still need a large list of all the
weaves and all the things you guys want them to do.  We've
got several partial lists, but I really want a 'This is all we
ever want to see' list of weaves and affects.

RP: Get some RP plots going again.  This place is looking
dead.  Events and fun quests (OOC or IC) would hit the spot
if you can get enough people on.

Everybody else: Find something to do.  I want every imm and
staff member to contribute - whatever way you want or can is

`7Subj`6:`7 greetings, and question about a bg
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Greetings.  I used to be on the mud a long time ago, and there was a couple rps that happened that I would like to keep, if possible.
the first one was a run in with "shadow" wolves, wolves that had been tainted by the dark wind of the ways.  With this run it, Miniver became tainted as well with dark thoughts and urges, which he was doing his best to control.  Wolves felt wary around him, but still accepted his fight.
The other rp was with one of the Chosen, I believe it was Maseama but I can't remember off hand.  She tricked Miniver into a portal and he ended up in t'a'r, for a bit.  Of course, we'd have to come up with another way he was rescued, but it was still an interesting RP to keep.
The only other thing I would ask, if I could also still keep darkfriends as the ones who killed my family and my brother, but it all seems overused.  
Thanks

with you (I don't have your list on me atm), yellows

can go play medic to the men in the warder tower (mae's

I'm gonna keep building the tower down towards the
ground.  Then i'm gonna need to write everything else
out on paper to see how many rooms we've got, then I'll
do the outdoors, the warder tower, and finally the
bridge between the two.  Very last thing will be
connecting the four gates to the Tar Valon island.

I've added more floors and worked out the attachment

How big a deal is it to add one more integer value field
to zedit? I want to be able to identify each zone as a
certain country or region (Andor, Cairhien, SF, etc).  That
way players make money according to whichever region they're
RPing in, not where they're from originally.  Otherwise
everybody would just choose the richest econ country and RP
being from wherever they want to be.

Also, I'm looking at making containers out of things like
pants and whatnot.  Currently, if you do that, the pants
can't have armor values.  I was thinking about recoding it
somehow (either so they can be both armor and a container,
and the values for each don't overlap).  What do you think?

(00:44:35) FryGuy8093: if we associate each zone with a country, then any RP done in that zone contributes to that country's econ, and the players get paid by the IC amount proportional to their economy.  as it's currently set up, players are just all going to choose the richest country as their own at creation, otherwise

Country vnums aren't contiguous, unfortunately - they're arranged in groups
on a grid, and since we left extreme left open for expansion, there are
gaps in the vnums.  Gonna have to edit the zone files themselves, I guess.

Well they're not mislinked per-se, but the "gate" is out of synch, it's open on one side
but locked and closed on the other, effectively making it one-way.
It's the south exit of room vnum 19373 and the north exit room vnum 16115
(vnums courtesy Duren)

Just something I stumbled on :) Au revoir

Cool, thanks.  I'm going to fix it for MM3.2, not for here - the BP

`7Subj`6:`7 Shield Source Lesson: From Cashik
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Shield Source

This weave is made entirely of spirit and used to cut another channeler off from the One Power just so that they cannot grasp or embrace Saidar.  It is not permanent but prevents them from channeling while the weave is in effect.

The weave is shaped as a concave disc with a -soft edge- and has to be placed between the target channeler and their connection to the One Power for it to be successful.  Cashik would weave one or two flows of spirit and split them many times, threading the seperated flows between each other in a lattice, then draw it together into a shield shape with a soft edge.  (A sharp edge severs)

Success at shielding a channeler depends on various factors: 1. how strong in the One Power you are compared to the target.  2. whether the target is already grasping Saidin/embracing Saidar - it is easy to shield someone not grasping/embracing (even if they are stronger in the OP than you.)  It is MUCH harder to shield someone who is grasping/embracing already.

Note: Strengthening your connection to the One Power seems to make it harder for someone to shield you too, so if you grasp more of Saidin it is harder for someone else to cut you off.

Since shield weaves from Aes Sedai cannot be seen by male channelers (the same is true for Aes Sedai not being able to see mc shield weaves either), the detection of an uncomfortable itching sensation could be used as an early warning (for males) of a shielding attempt from a woman (as they are channeling).  Extreme caution around women should be the usual response to such a sensation.

Tactics: Force a person who is trying to shield you to be distracted and divert their energy on something else, this weakens their attempt on shielding you, then their shield could be sliced.  Slicing a shield causes disorientation to the person who has their shield sliced, offering a good opportunity for counter-shielding which could be more effective.

Tactics: Tying a shield on a strong channeler is not an ideal idea because tied shields are weaker and can be broken out of easier than ones that are maintained.

When shielded, a channeler can sense the One Power but cannot grasp/embrace it.  Resistance to try and re-form the connection and break through the shield is possible, but takes time.  You can will Saidin towards you as strongly as you can - this causes a shield to weaken somewhat.  If someone is maintaining the shield they can re-strengthen it, and it becomes more difficult to break through it.  It takes effort to maintain a shield on someone, and so, it may be neccesary for other channelers to help.

End of Lesson.

BAGHDAD, Iraq - Witnesses to the slaying of 24 Iraqi civilians by U.S. Marines in the western town of Haditha say the Americans shot men, women and children at close range in retaliation for the death of a Marine lance corporal in a roadside bombing.
Aws Fahmi, a Haditha resident who said he watched and listened from his home as Marines went from house to house killing members of three families, recalled hearing his neighbor across the street, Younis Salim Khafif, plead in English for his life and the lives of his family members. "I heard Younis speaking to the Americans, saying: 'I am a friend. I am good,' " Fahmi said. "But they killed him, and his wife and daughters."
The 24 Iraqi civilians killed on Nov. 19 included children and the women who were trying to shield them, witnesses told a Washington Post special correspondent in Haditha this week and U.S. investigators said in Washington. The girls killed inside Khafif's house were ages 14, 10, 5, 3 and 1, according to death certificates.

Two U.S. military boards are investigating the incident as potentially the gravest violation of the law of war by U.S. forces in the three-year-old conflict in Iraq. The U.S. military ordered the probes after Time magazine presented military officials in Baghdad this year with the findings of its own investigation, based on accounts of survivors and on a videotape shot by an Iraqi journalism student at Haditha's hospital and inside victims' houses.
An investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service into the killings and a separate military probe into an alleged coverup are slated to end in the next few weeks. Marines have briefed members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and other officials on the findings: some of the officials briefed say the evidence is damaging. Charges of murder, dereliction of duty and making a false statement are likely, people familiar with the case said Friday.
"Marines overreacted . . . and killed innocent civilians in cold blood," said one of those briefed, Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.), a former Marine who maintains close ties with senior Marine officers despite his opposition to the war.
Haditha is one of a chain of farm towns on the Euphrates River where U.S. and Iraqi forces have battled foreign and local insurgents without resolution for much of the war. The first account of the killings there was a false or erroneous statement issued the next day, Nov. 20, by a

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Aelene Theris was born sixteen years ago, the second daughter of
Lord Markev and Lady Jolana Theris of Andor, in the capital city of
Caemlyn.  Her father also engaged in  merchanting, managing estates
and trade routes with ease and as such is considered quite well off
by some.  As a result of this, Aelene was raised in an environment
far above the normal individual.  She received a fine education from
the tutors her parents hired for herself and her three siblings (an
elder sister and brother, and younger brother).

In many ways she was the most left behind out of all of Markev and
Jolana's children, being both the youngest daughter, and the second
youngest of them all.  While she received the same amount of
attention from her family as the others, it was clear that their
main focus was on her elder sister, for marriage to another family
of good standing, and her two brothers in suceeding her father in
his duties.  While some talk of marriage was mentioned for Aelene
herself, she felt no desire to marry for the purpose of making
connections.

Partly to escape the feeling of being forced into a life she didn't
want, and the feelings of being subtly neglected, the girl departed
for Tar Valon.  In some ways, it was the best decision both for her
and the family.  Should she be able to become Aes Sedai, it would
still increase the family honor, while at the same time lessen the
obligation of providing a future for a second daughter.  Her parents
condoned the action, and as such she was sent to the White Tower to
see what fate would hold for her.

still increase the family honor, while at the same time lessen the
obligation of providing a future for a second daughter.  Her parents
condoned the action, and as such she was sent to the White Tower to
see what fate would hold for her.

`7From`6:`7 Phaedra
`7Subj`6:`7 FYI...
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Stuff you would notice post FTB:

-Phaedra's scar.  When describing her assault by the guy in Amadicia, she probably downplayed it somewhat.  The scar runs the entire width of her lower abdomen, from the bottom left part of her hipbone up and across to the top of her right hipbone.  It is relatively straight, but was clearly either caused by a dull/crappy blade or stitched poorly - potentially both (if you ask, she doesn't remember which, and concedes that both may have been the case.  The person who stitched her was a Whitecloak surgeon, used to dealing with men's battle injuries).  It is bright white and smooth, indicating years' worth of healing.

-Phaedra's tattoo.  Yes, she's got one.  Upper right hip at the central uppermost point of the bone there is a small (inch and a half tall, half inch wide) tattoo of a rose in partial bloom with a long stem.  Careful inspection will show that the stem is wrapped in a delicate chain.  The craftsmanship of the piece is remarkable, but the picture itself somewhat disturbing.  If you notice it, she will tell you to ask about it later, and it will clearly kill the mood if you press her on it.  Doesn't take a genius to figure out why she has it...

-Phaedra's... skill...  Whatever else Kinje may have done to her, he certainly trained her well.  No blushing maiden, she.  Responsive and vocal (go figure), Phae is wholehearted and uninhibited, but does not take herself (or you) too seriously.

Just some things I wanted to let you know before I forgot that you would have noticed them, as they are fairly important details that one misses in a FTB.  *smooch*

I am happy to see that you decided to come back. :>

I was worried that you would have left, and no one wanted that.

As far as the Tower goes, I think it would be nice to have a
classroom to give lessons, a garden/fish pond outside the Tower,
some kind of Plaza, or Square,  where we could RP outside also,
Umm.. And don't forget to build a room where we can give the
Accepted Test! It is located underneath the Tower.

Besides that, the normal Ajah Halls, Amyrlin Sitting Room, Keeper's
rooms, an actual Hall for the Sitters to meet in, Novice/Accepted
quarters, -maybe- a Kitchen (dunno if it's needed, but it would
be nicee to send girls there for chore RP) and.. *thinks* I guess
that is enough for now. =)

Also, most of the Towers I have seen have been more like mazes, 
and difficult to navigate. Hopefully, when you lay it out, you
can focus on making it easier to get around. If you need help,
let me know. I am much better at layout and design, mapping and
linking rooms, than I am with descs though. Descs take me forever.

OH! And don't forget a small little area for the Warders. We
can't forget them.

**This letter is written on thick parchment, sealed in gold wax with an imprint of a harp.  The script is recognizably Phaedra's, but is somewhat stilted in places, the ink heavy in some areas and light in others.**

Kinje,

I cannot recall a time at was at such a loss for words.  Part of me is angry at myself for not knowing that you would misinterpret what I wrote for you.  Part of me is berating myself for ever leaving the house, to allow for this to happen in the first place.  Part of me is so angry with you that, were I to dwell on that anger, would harden the love I have for you into a burning hatred.  Part of me cannot help but continue to hold on to the love I have always had for you.

I cannot forgive what you have done, regardless of the cause you feel you had.  I know you love me - and did not need this bond to prove it - but what you did was not for me.  It was for you.  You willfully and forcibly sacrificed my freedom for all of time to capture a single moment of proof that I did not require.

You asked me why I wanted you to go.  The answer has changed, though now it is a moot point.  I want my mind and my free will back.  I do not want either of us to become embittered toward the other, but I am dangerously close to that now.  You have said that you will honor my wishes, but when given the chance to make good on that promise, you not only did not do as I wished, you entwined yourself in my life so deeply that it is now impossible for you to do so.

I am sorry that what I wrote clouded my wishes in your mind and brought my resolve into question.  I am sorry that I am bringing you continual pain, even now, after I had thought it would all be over.  I love you, still Kinje, even though what you have done to me has shaken the foundation of my soul.  I am afraid to see you because I know what this connection is capable of, and while I believe with all my heart, in pieces though it may be, that you will not harm me, I also know that you bonding me in the first place was, to you, an act of love - despite my wishes to the contrary.

Though I have been dismissed from my position from within Lord Traemane's House because he feels I can no longer be trusted, I remain here by request.  I am honoring the request this time and will not be leaving to see you.  Too much has been lost to me for me to risk the rest.  I will remain in contact with you so you know that I am safe, but please do not test my resolve again.  I am walking a finely-honed blade of trust, truth, and sanity.

I am as safe as I can be, all things considered.  I choose to believe I have some free will remaining, though, and if I require your help - should the offer still be valid - I will call on you.

Phaedra

P.S.  Your poem was beautiful, but changes nothing.

`7From`6:`7 Sadren
`7Subj`6:`7 Not so short and sweet...
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Alright.. 

  First off, congratulations! Nice to see that we finally got 
someone to fill in this much needed position.
  Now, I have been pondering everything you've asked. As far as
the things that I am comfortable sticking my nose in.. First of all,
anything dealing with the Tower, Daes, or Aiel are going to be
my strong points. At the moment, I am attempting to use Sadren
to try and reuinte the Tower. I don't like the ideda of a split
Tower on this mud because we simply don't have the player-base
for a single Tower, let alone two.
  I would like to see some RP involving the Seanchan take place.
They are the best, but most underused, source of conflict RP
on the mud. However, I know very little about the Seanchan as
a race so I don't think I would be extremely helpful as far as
that goes.
  The idea of mort GLs pleases me a great deal. The main attributes
that should be looked for in a GL is activity, and the willingness
and ability to deal with OOC issues. Also, the GLs should have definate
ideas about where they want the guild to go. They should be able to
create an outline of what they want to do with the guild and how 
they plan to accomplish those goals. 
  Nicodemus told me that you would like to work with me.. I'm
not sure what capacity you want to use me in. Whether it is as an
Imm or a Mort GL, either way I will be happy. (Although I have
to admit,  I definately have had my eye on GLing the Tower ever
since I first started GLing). 
  Things that I think need to be handled.. First, not every guild
will have the players needed to be given a GL. I think that at
least five active members (active meaning log on for RP once a
week at least) should be needed before you make a GL for that
guild. The guilds that I think should definately have GLs are
the Tower, Daes, and Asha'man. The next important guilds would
be Seanchan, Aiel, and guilds that create conflict (ie. CotL).
  Secondly,  we need to establish a firm setting for the mud.
By setting, I mean state clearly what regions are under who's
control, where are Seanchan,  where are Shaido, what the weather 
is like,  etc. Also, whether or not we have book characters, I 
think positions such as the Amyrlin, and the Queen of Andor are 
important. I would personally like to see those positions attainable
by PCs, rather than require them to be book characters. However,
since it appears that book characters are done with (for now) we
should still keep those characters in play, either by making them
Imm-controlled when needed,  or allowing GLs to control them. The
entire flow of RP can be affected by a single decision from such
a high authority such as the Amyrlin, or a Queen. It's an RP
tool that should be used more often.
  Thirdly, we need to work on recruiting more people.  When our
setting and timeline,  and new GLs get into place, we should go
out and begin advertising on places like mudconnector.com, mudmagic.com
and placees such as that. Tyme was the best WoT mud around for
quite some time,  but it's reputation has sank quite a bit over
the last few years. I have seen reviews stating that Tyme is a
dead mud, or that Tyme is a horrible place because of Imm-Player
problems. We should hand out QPs for people who post positive reviews,
as well as making some kind of reward for voting for Tyme on mudconnector.
Another mud I saw gave double exp for an hour if you voted,  and
you could do it twice a day. Rewards like that will make people go
and review/vote, causing Tyme's reputation to once again stand as
one of the best WoT muds out there.
   
   I don't know what else you'd like to hear, but I am full of
ideas for the mud. Right now, Sadren is planning a return to Tar Valon
to handle the Asha'man threat posed to the White Tower. She is also
doing her best to find allies who will support her if she attempts to
become Amyrlin (which she wants). I think we should do our best to create
multiple RP areas, giving people more freedom to choose what kind of
character they want.
  I'm tired and can't think anymore! I am going to lay down for a bit, I
think. Anyways, I'll be waiting for your reply! Ask me more questions,
I'll give you more answwers. Thanks for coming to me for advice, and
including me in helping out. Tyme is my home, and the people are my family.
I just want to see Tyme succeed, and return to it's glory days again. =-)
 
See you!
Sadren

Lady Bard,

It has come to my attention that you may know someone I am looking for.  This man has dark, almond shaped eyes, short dark hair, and is of Saldaean or perhaps Altaran decent.  He is pale, though there is a hint of olive to his skin, and in his late twenties, or early thirties.  After speaking with someone we both know, she indicated that the two of you had some connection.  If you could give me this man's name, or any other details, I would be forever in your debt.

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Razyc,
 
  I am sending this to you with all haste. It appears that
our friend, Jerod Traemane, has had me Gated to Tear instead
of Tar Valon. I am headed to the river so I can charter a
ship heading north to Aringill and beyond. 
  
  Lord Jerod Traemane is an Asha'man, poppet. You must avoid
him at all costs. He will do anything to advance his own agenda.
It appears that the Asha'man have entrenched themselves deeply
into Andoran politics. I doubt Elayne has any firm control
beyond what they let her have.
  
  I do not know what I shall do when I arrive in Tar Valon.
There is the threat the black-coats bring lingering over the
Tower, the threat of Tarmon Gai'don lingering over the world.
I have done my best to get things in order, but my best
has been woefully deficient.
 
  Few times in my life before have I been at a loss for what
to do. This is one of those times. The only thing that I can
suggest to you, my sweetling, is that you do your best to
out Jerod Traemane. You must do so in the shadows, however,
and prevent him from knowing it is you. I have a small purse
of diamonds.. the diamonds that studded my hair during your
birthday party. Take them. Use them as payment, if you must.
They are in a secret hole hidden under a wood panel in the 
closet in the Queen's Blessing. Use them to help spread the
word and do what you must to bring Jerod Traemane to his
knees. But do not be seen to be connected with it yourself.
 
  I said I shall send word when I arrive at the Tower.. I
still will, but I do not expect you to come. You are not ready
to handle the difficulties that shall exist once I arrive there.
Be patient, be loyal, be steadfast. We shall be together once
more.
  
  I send you love with this letter. The love of a mother over
her blossoming young boy.. the love of a woman for her heart.
The love I send is tenfold now that I have been parted from
you. Be steadfast, my lion. We shall be together again.

Razyc,
 
  I am sending this to you with all haste. It appears that
our friend, Jerod Traemane, has had me Gated to Tear instead
of Tar Valon. I am headed to the river so I can charter a
ship heading north to Aringill and beyond. 
  
  Lord Jerod Traemane is an Asha'man, poppet. You must avoid
him at all costs. He will do anything to advance his own agenda.
It appears that the Asha'man have entrenched themselves deeply
into Andoran politics. I doubt Elayne has any firm control
beyond what they let her have.
  
  I do not know what I shall do when I arrive in Tar Valon.
There is the threat the black-coats bring lingering over the
Tower, the threat of Tarmon Gai'don lingering over the world.
I have done my best to get things in order, but my best
has been woefully deficient.
 
  Few times in my life before have I been at a loss for what
to do. This is one of those times. The only thing that I can
suggest to you, my sweetling, is that you do your best to
out Jerod Traemane. You must do so in the shadows, however,
and prevent him from knowing it is you. I have a small purse
of diamonds.. the diamonds that studded my hair during your
birthday party. Take them. Use them as payment, if you must.
They are in a secret hole hidden under a wood panel in the 
closet in the Queen's Blessing. Use them to help spread the
word and do what you must to bring Jerod Traemane to his
knees. But do not be seen to be connected with it yourself.
 
  I said I shall send word when I arrive at the Tower.. I
still will, but I do not expect you to come. You are not ready
to handle the difficulties that shall exist once I arrive there.
Be patient, be loyal, be steadfast. We shall be together once
more.
  
  I send you love with this letter. The love of a mother over
her blossoming young boy.. the love of a woman for her heart.
The love I send is tenfold now that I have been parted from
you. Be steadfast, my lion. We shall be together again.
  
*signed simply*
The Blood of Tarabon

Hello,

It is my understanding that you have the honor of playing 'all'
of the bookies. Gratz on that. That being the case, I need to talk
with you about setting up an RP between Elayne (who I am led to
believe is in charge in Caemlyn) and either myself or Alaura.
The purpose of the meeting will be to 1) establish a Band embassy
in Caemlyn officially. 2) Gain permission to set up an embassy
location with suitable number of Banders in residence (honor guard).
And 3) Coordinate the defense of the southern border against the
Seanchan. (If you were not aware the Band have been in Maerone for
quite a while now fortifying and preparing for the SC move north.
This is in the interests of providing a link between Andor and
Cairhien so it might be adviseable to have an Andoran military
type in attendance.)

Thanks

Tallyn

AS vs AM addendum
Hey Luc

Thanks again for talking to me today.. 

Something I nearly forgot about until Asherly brought it up: 

`!Asherly tells you, 'And there are far far far to many AS and Accepted compared to the numbers that Peyton brought, he will have a 1:1 ratio just against the AS, if the Accepted make circles he loses. ' `0
Providing of course there are only 250 AS in the Tower, but even doing the #'s, there would be more than that. There wont be a lot of novices who could be pulled into a link, but the ones who have been able to embrace, can. And the Accepted could be pulled into links as well. 

Just one more thing to think about. I dont envy you at all. :)

Hye, I've just join and I present myself to you. )ouch missed my first show off(
I wrote a background for a training first character based on a warder from Tear
Within the time I "at last..." finished my training I want to create a male Channeler player 
with double personnality and so on.
I over-estimate me as an average-good role player, so I won't bother chores and will try to 
lighten the burden of my tutors.

I'm ready to post my IG bio, I did check the site, 
Some questions raise yet, where and when do I post my background to be approved, could you direct me
to the Warder's Guild GL then ? 
For the newbie part of the mail : How do I connect without the create a new carac every time ? I suppose
it will stop when Belain's account will be registred and I will provide user/pass only then.

Thank you for the post's deciphering,
BBelain, hoping for a Warder's assignement in Tower's school.

Um.. why is Peyton telling the Asha'man that they are going to be
occupying the White Tower, and forcing every Aes Sedai to take an Oath
to harm no Asha'man, by action or inaction, and to help no person who
is restrained by an Asha'man.. or STILL them? (Not shield them. The plans
have been changed. STILL them.)

You told me you were not handing the White Tower to them. I trusted you, Luc.
The White Tower had weeks to plan their defenses. They know how to link up to
circles of thirteen. This would not be a cakewalk. And I don't think that just
because Peyton wants to do it that it should be allowed.

I am trusting you to handle this issue, Luc. But I refuse to RP with any Asha'man
until this has been decided. They are trying to force me to teach them how to Link
with women, and things like that. I'm not going to sit around and teach them how
to be even MORE powerful. 

Thank you.

Hey sweetie!

If you're still interested in doing a write-up for TMC and other mud connection sites, please let me know.  We've been given the go-ahead for that, just not for Wiki.  There are a few things Nico wants included (and -doesn't- want included), so if you've got something already or have things in mind, I'd love to see them so I can make sure it's all there.

If you're not still interested in doing that, don't worry about it, I just remember you saying you wanted to be on the front lines of PR, and I'm more than happy to let you if you're still hoping to be.  :D

Love and kisses!

`#Sabrina`7 gets:

One `&angreal`7 of average strength (Sabrina, please get with me regarding what it looks like)

`!C`1ostume `!c`1ube`7: (ter'angreal) Fist-sized cube of a worked greyish metal.  Each side is patterned slightly differently, and when channeled into, each creates a different (pre-programmed and unchangeable) disguise as per Mirror of Mists.  This disguise remains on the channeler as long as the cube is within ten feet of her.  Cannot be used on others.  Saidar only.  (Sabrina, please get with me regarding the six disguises you get so we can hammer it out and have it documented, thanks.)

`7S`8aidinvining `7r`8od`7: (ter'angreal) A small two-pronged rod appearing to be made of a preserved redwood.  When a male channeler is within ten feet, it begins to quiver and, if held by the two prongs, point in the direction of the MC in question.  If Saidin is being held but not channeled, it becomes 20 feet, if channeled, 30 feet.

`#Kinje`7 gets:

One `&angreal`7 of average strength - This appears to be a plain, unworked golden band, large enough to be worn by a man.

One `&sa'angreal`7 of average strength - This is in the form of a belt made of seamless links of polished black material.

`^T`6riage`7: (ter'angreal) This curved, white semi-circle is about a foot in radius, and always appears antiseptic and spotlessly clean.  It is smooth, but covered in slight protrusions and knobs that feel cold to the touch.  When touched with a Healing weave, the knobs grow warm, almost too warm to hold comfortably.  After the Ter'angreal has been 'primed' with a Healing weave, for about a number of hours after, it will reproduce a weaker version of that same weave on anything living placed inside the open portion of the circle.  

The stronger and better constructed the original weave, the stronger and better constructed the one that is reproduced, but it is not a perfect ratio.  Relatively weak Healing is reproduced at about half strength, stronger Healing at about one quarter, and extremely powerful Healing at closer to a fifth.  However, the stronger the initial weave, the longer it will work.  

Weak Healing can be reproduced for about 12 hours, moderate Healing for about 24, and strong Healing up to 48.  It takes about ten minutes for the ter'angreal to work, during which time the knobs gradually grow cool as the weave takes effect.  It then takes the rest of an hour for them to heat back up to operating temperature, at which point the ter'angreal is ready to be used once more.  Inscribed along the outer curve of the handle in a flowing, elegant script is "Tovya ge Sora."


They also picked up some random trade goods that had been stored, but nothing else of any Power value.

Please see me with questions.

When a male channeler is within ten feet, it begins to quiver and, if held by the two prongs, point in the direction of the MC in question.  If Saidin is being held but not channeled, it becomes 20 feet, if channeled, 30 feet.

`#Kinje`7 gets:

One `&angreal`7 of average strength - This appears to be a plain, unworked golden band, large enough to be worn by a man.

One `&sa'angreal`7 of average strength - This is in the form of a belt made of seamless links of polished black material.

`^T`6riage`7: (ter'angreal) This curved, white semi-circle is about a foot in radius, and always appears antiseptic and spotlessly clean.  It is smooth, but covered in slight protrusions and knobs that feel cold to the touch.  When touched with a Healing weave, the knobs grow warm, almost too warm to hold comfortably.  After the Ter'angreal has been 'primed' with a Healing weave, for about a number of hours after, it will reproduce a weaker version of that same weave on anything living placed inside the open portion of the circle.  

The stronger and better constructed the original weave, the stronger and better constructed the one that is reproduced, but it is not a perfect ratio.  Relatively weak Healing is reproduced at about half strength, stronger Healing at about one quarter, and extremely powerful Healing at closer to a fifth.  However, the stronger the initial weave, the longer it will work.  

Weak Healing can be reproduced for about 12 hours, moderate Healing for about 24, and strong Healing up to 48.  It takes about ten minutes for the ter'angreal to work, during which time the knobs gradually grow cool as the weave takes effect.  It then takes the rest of an hour for them to heat back up to operating temperature, at which point the ter'angreal is ready to be used once more.  Inscribed along the outer curve of the handle in a flowing, elegant script is "Tovya ge Sora."


They also picked up some random trade goods that had been stored, but nothing else of any Power value.

Please see me with questions.

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
This is the app to get my alt into the Aes Sedai guild.  I talked with you about her
very briefly last Sunday, and have decided to go ahead and start with her even before
the other issues are cleared up.

I would like to start her as a Newly Raised Red Sister... shawled mere days before the
assault on the White Tower.  She would be resentful of the Red's loss of power, most
likely, which would make for interesting RP.

Background:
Kadiana was born and raised on the city streets of Cairhien.  Her father was a small
time merchant, mostly dealing in rare and hard to find items.  Her mother used to be
a seamstress.  She had an older brother who ran away when she was around 12 years old,
and she found herself heir-apparent to her father's business.  She threw herself into
the task of learning all of the nuances of the merchant buisness, and also learned to
read, write and do numbers as well so she could take over the business.  It was at
that time she met Raja Gallantin, and took a job running errands for him in exchange
for his tutelage not only in the merchant business, but also to improve her skills
with writing and math.

Her brother, she suspected, ran off because he was a male channeler and disappeared
into the ranks of the Asha'man possibly.  It was his disappearance that brought on
the illness that forced her mother into retirement.  Although she likes men, she has
a deep-seated hatred of male channelers, not only for what her brother's
disappearance (if that was the real reason) did to her family, as well as the deep
prejudices that run in her family.  No one has explained WHY her family hates them
more than the average population, even before the days of the Black Tower, and she
has never asked.

She was discovered by an Aes Sedai who traded with her father, and was taken to
the White Tower.  There, she was a model student and advanced fairly quickly through
her training.  Her mother passed away shortly after she left for the White Tower,
the loss of another child too much for the weak woman to bear.  Her father died
shortly thereafter.  Raja Gallantin holds the business in trust until Kadiana's
return, and it was her return to Cairhien that drove her forward in her studies.

Though she knows she can't take over the business and still be Aes Sedai, she is eager
to get all of her father's affairs in order, and to put her past behind her as she
steps into her future ahead.


Let me know if you have any questions.  Raja is a PC, though her brother is not.

Ilorin,

I wanted to drop you a note as the SC GL, to let you know that Rienne, the daughter of
a prominent Domani merchant house, and Termiane, the sell-sword who brought Valkaria
out of Arad Doman, have exchanged lists of Domani they know who might be interested in
joining the Resistance against the Seanchan. Term would put together a list of other
mercenaries, random people related to his family, and maybe the servant in Philipe
Ankaer's household who helped get him into the house, while I assume Rienne's list would
be centered around her family and their merchant contacts (although she can give more
details). The Seekers would probably hear -something- about some suspicious meetings,
so if you want to do anything about it, you can probably talk to the War Department
about it.

If you have any questions, either of us can undoubtedly answer them.

bellsouth (although it -could- have been Earthlink, but I highly doubt
it, that would have been like seven years or more ago)

Thanks for checking, Duren. :)

Also, if you look at his desc, and he has one, he would be Domani, and
I remember him having a blue vest that was opened, showing his chest.

The white tower zones are 94,95 and 96.  I set up the OLC for those zones on your file
for the BP.

Let me know if you have questions about the layout.  Thanks!!

we need all references to our site to be updated to tymemud.com - we're leaving envy and it is vital that people can connect to our new server.

In terms of what to add, Duren says, "I would mention that we are rebuilding combat from scratch.  That the new system utilizes nearly 50 different bodyparts, very realisticially coded forms with special procedures.... Umm, what else can we say.  There is no ETA, of course, since the only people who are working on it are Me and Nico.."

So, write up something pretty.  :)  The combat revamp and the server are the two key points, though.  Thanks again for your work on this.

I wanted to talk to you about the layout of the Tower, and if you had
some kind of map or layout design that I could see.. I kind of get what
you did, but the Novice/Accepted Wings are all halls, no rooms. It
doesn't really make sense to me, and I'd rather talk to you about it
before I go messing things up.

This is in reference to zones 94/95/96 (mostly 94 and 95 though)

A Moment in Tyme (MiT) is one of the oldest Wheel of Time 
based Muds on the Internet.  Since 1994, our coders and 
builders have been working hard to bring in unique new 
features and our own original areas.  MiT is currently on 
our second major revision of the codebase, and our areas 
are all completely original.  At A Moment in Tyme, we have 
a dedicated playerbase and an excellent, committed staff of 
Immortals.  We have unique systems in place to rank 
players' mastery in swordplay and channeling (Wheel of 
Time's magic system).
 
A Moment in Tyme is set on a Timeline that is based on the
first six books. After that, though, Tyme has broken away
to become a mirror world of the books. The Bowl of the Winds
has been found and used, breaking the long winter. Elayne
has returned to Andor and taken the Throne. After a long
struggle, Analinde su Riaten Rie now controls Cairhien
with Rand al'Thor's, the Dragon Reborn, approval. 
 
The White Tower has split, but after a Black Tower raid 
against the Aes Sedai, Elaida has been kidnapped and now 
awaits trial before the newly reunified Tower. Who will be
Amyrlin now? Already several woman are seeking the title.
 
And the Seanchan? Tarabon, Arad Doman, and Altara are
all victims of the Ever Victorious Army. The High Lady
Suroth invaded, and conquered Murandy, instead of reaching
into Amadicia. Because of this, High Lady Ilorin Shayndel 
Paendrag, fourth in line for the Crystal Throne, has 
officially settled into the Panarch's Palace and taken
control of the Hailene. Who will stop them? Word is that 
a mercenary group called the Heron Company is being raised
to retake Arad Doman...
 
A Moment in Tyme is a RP-intensive MUD. We have an RPexp
system which rewards RP by giving EXP based on emotes. 
Combat Code is currently offline, as it is being completely
remodified and built from the ground up. It will utilize
50 different body parts as well as have very realistically
coded forms with special procedures.

`7Subj`6:`7 Background for Lio Ezara
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Hi there! Here is a background for Lio Ezara. This background is written to the rank of Accepted, though she has been Aes Sedai on Dragons Fang for over 5 years (real time). I hope you enjoy the reading :) Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
 
Lio Ezara
 
DISCLAIMER : This is NOT, repeat, NOT a Sedai-with-a-sword background! That said, please read on... :)
 
Lio's childhood was somewhat complicated. She was the only daughter of a general in the Shienaran army and her three brothers -- two elder, one younger -- constantly kept her on her toes. And they constantly reminded her of the fact that she was a girl, unable to keep up with their races, unable to best them at anything physical and unable to follow their father's footsteps into the soldier's ranks. Now, granted, a woman of Shienar tends to be able to hold her own when necessary, but there was just something really frustrating to Lio about not being able to fall into place with her brothers and help to protect her homeland. While they looked forward to prestigious military careers, bringing glory to the family name and keeping Shienar safe, Lio was left with suggestions about finding a "nice boy to settle down with" and raise a family of her own... She felt like growling at every person who said that to her. 
 
Eventually, Lio entered the age in which all children naturally rebel against their parents. Somewhere around her 15th or 16th summer, she started wanting to train with the boys but of course her mother disallowed it, saying that she should focus on learning or domestic endeavors. Well, "learning" didn't seem to be the thing that would fulfill her youthful patriotism, given the fact that you can't kill a Trolloc with a book, and "domestic endeavors" were almost entirely out of the question.  What talent she showed in this area -- leatherworking, to a degree -- was something she resented because it might mean that someone, somewhere would try to force her to become a seamstress. And that she could not abide. 
 
As fate would have it, one autumn Lio's mother received a reprieve from her wayward daughter by the passage of an Aes Sedai and Warder pair through the village on their way to some undisclosed location along the Border. The pair brought every eager young soldier in the village to hopefully eye the Gaidin, wishing to observe some secret on how to train better, how to learn faster, how to be quicker... Of course, none dared approach them too boldly, but sufficient was their exposure in the village for the path of Lio and the Aes Sedai to cross. Whatever journey that the Aes Sedai and her Warder had been on was now shelved, and the Ezara family was startled by a solid knock on their door a day or two after the sister had seen Lio. 
 
The rest of the story proceeds as one might expect -- the Aes Sedai was firm on the notion that Lio should be presented to the White Tower at Tar Valon to begin her training, post haste, and she herself was going to escort the girl there. That the sister was somewhat displeased by having her previous task derailed was evident but not so compulsory as to stop her from having Lio packed up and on a horse within the week. The protests began almost immediately from Lio, but then one simple fact was explained to her in detail -- her power, should she refine it, would be more effective against the advance of the Shadow than any sword, pole-arm or projectile, and that she could use that power in defense of Shienar and the rest of the Light-loving world. After that conversation, the trio set out for Tar Valon together, and Lio did everything she could to hasten the journey. 
 
In the arms of Tower discipline, Lio seemed to finally find her calling. The chores and lessons were nothing beside the chance to learn how to weave with Saidar. Once Lio was able to taste it on her own, under the close observation of a strong teacher, she discovered a deep and undividing passion for learning stronger and more efficient ways to manipulate Saidar. At last, it seemed, she had in her hands a solid strength that could stand against the Shadow and bring honor to the Ezara name. With this firmly in mind, she threw herself into her studies, excelling at every task (though struggling somewhat with the BORING history) and chomping at the bit for more. It was even said, from time to time, that she should slow herself and cease the single-minded devouring of all the lessons and instructors assignments that she could get her hands on. Her test to Accepted came four years after her admission to the Tower -- right before her 20th birthday.
 
During her time as an Accepted, Lio focused herself primarily on studying two things -- battle and diplomacy. She had learned, through her upbringin

There is nothing unusual about the day.  Sunlight is warm at his back and a cool breeze touches his skin, muted where thin fabric shelters his torso from biting insects.  The breeze helps with that, confusing their delicate flight away from a determined path to his sweat and breath.  He might have seen nineteen summers, seven years old almost to the day, and he has all of his height and most of his weight.  In fact, it is not until much later that he loses muscle mass gained from farm work and training, and loses it rapidly at that.  Those things are far away from him now, his senses filled with quiet sounds punctuated by the sharp calls of birds and the occasional blare of nearby rodents' argument over resources.

The most remarkable aspect of the day --of which he is unaware at this moment-- is his complete and poignant lack of discomfort.  He slaps at a fly or gnat that has clung to his skin, more out of irritation than pain as he scarcely notices it.  There are other dangers here, the Blight reaching out under the land and through the waterways into the south, sometimes so far as his family's holdings.  His scent therefore is scrubbed away from him and replaced as well as possible with the smell of leafed and woody plants, dulled by clay and altered by fir.  Although his hair is braided, the bells on strands woven into it are silent, well-spaced and hollow decoration, present for tradition but non-functional.  In the city, he will have to redo the braids and replace the bells.
It is no great disturbance to him that while he walks the quiet forest, he is suddenly not just outside of his familial holdings but at the side of a road as he emerges from the woods, and if he had to guess a position, which he doesn't, he would say he was south of Shol Arbola and not too far away at that.  He takes the road toward the city, the sunlight bright and hot, and the flies thick as they converge to movement, darting away from piles of dung from many sorts of cart and pack animals.
A wagon sits at the side of the road at a bend, both front wheels off, with a guard leaning against the back wheel as a woman in ornate clothing inspects the front axle.  There is nothing odd about this, to his mind, and as he approaches, he nods to Vance, who shrugs at him and gives him a mixed look of long suffering and tolerance both.  Telen says, "You're farther north than I expected you would be," and he isn't sure why he expected Vance to be south, but it is a good thing he caught him before going into the city.  He feels it is a good thing, though how Vance is here south of Shol Arbola with Brienne and Lierna, he could not say.  No, it isn't Lierna, it is Rienne straightening up from her inspection of the wagon's axle, with her inexpert wield of Domani wiles and sloppy execution of Light given graces.  Bloody hell.  He had been looking forward to seeing Lierna.  Resignation combines sickeningly with arousal.
He shrugs off the disappointment.  He is still looking forward to seeing her in the city.  Isn't he? He turns away from Rienne smiling at him to scan the woods and stare down the road toward the south.  Southeast.  No, no, she's here, somewhere.  For an instant, he knows he is dreaming and all his will twists at the fabric of it.  It is a fabric of woven bands of steel, flexible but noncompliant, and his will abrades and bleeds upon it.  Dreamscape resumes as if uninterrupted.  Bright sun beats down upon sandy hair and warms his shoulders.  Light pales the primary colors of noon with brightness, casting deep black shadows in pools below pines thickly carpeted in green grey needles.  
What should remain memory is drawn out on silken threads and blends seamlessly with strands of possibility.  It is and it isn't Rienne's hand on his shoulder, one finger laid against the skin of his neck so that from between his shoulder blades to the nape of his neck all of the fine hairs are standing.  By the tingle of it, those at the nape of his neck are bristling as well.  He has walked the forest beside his family's house with only his long dagger and walked the road with a longsword at his hip, but when a dark shape wheels a shadow across the road, he is stepping forward away from warmth like a second sun and drawing twin blades from his back sheath.  His linen and wool are leathers, and there is thin metal plate reinforcing a cuirass and bracers laced to his chest and forearms.
The forest explodes with darkness, hoary and ragged shapes emerging from light and shadow as if the pools below the pines are rearing to shake ham fists, sprouting weapons and charging forward.  A cloud passes over the sun and the land becomes many shades of grey, the distinction between glowing highlight and velvet shadow blurring.  There is a tinny shriek,

He wishes to be still and feign death.  His treacherous body shakes as an aspen leaf shivers in the slightest twist of air, and his back feels as unbending as if he were impaled.  It does not matter now if any of the others live.  He hopes they do not, for it is from here to the cookfires, if the Trollocs are patient enough for cookfires.  Another body rolls into his and he turns to look, eyes glazed as he searches for physical connections.  One hand in the grass, empty, fingers move.  His other hand is around the hilt of a sword or dagger.  A sword.  Pinned under him awkwardly, no movement, and he fears to try to loosen his grip.  A mass of dark hair matted and seeded with sand fills his vision, pale skin under it.  Unnaturally pale.  Drained.
The taloned feet at his side dig into the ground as weight shifts, cartilage grinding against drying dirt, and air moves in a foul, smoky draft trailing a black-beaked head as it swoops down open and buries deeply into the still warm body.  It jerks.  The beak comes up trailing pink and coiling ropes, spraying moisture in a wide spatter.  He gasps and forces his fist behind him several inches along the ground.  A dark and knowing eye connects with his, its flat black wheel of iris constricting on a fathomless pupil.  The Trolloc shakes a massive beak drooping broken innards and dives again, one divided foot rising and planting solidly on his midsection, which does not stop his body's rattling but it does arrest his attempt to wield.
Another sound has intruded, unnoticed until the pulsing grey tones of dream shatter, bringing him into the world halfway, where he hangs and shudders, crying or heaving.  It doesn't matter.  He hates.  As soon as he can move, he is feeling for something to throw, finding nothing edged is of no particular note.  He rolls off his bed to the floor in a half curl, hardly feeling the fall.  Nightmare remains living in him as pain scrapes along his skeleton, wrapping thorny around it and clinging, tangling in nerves.  He can reach the leg of his chair from where he is panting on the floor and he grasps it and lifts it to hurl at the door with all his strength.  The door ceases its unpleasant rapping from the outside as it is pummeled from the inside, a new dent marring the finish as the chair falls and skews to its back.
The reverberations slowly cease their adept wringing, and he comes out of dream into waking as though he has been devoured literally and now is reborn from death.  He still hates but he can feel it bleeding out of him with the need for violence instinctive to stemming pain and horror.  Maybe more horror than pain.  He is used to pain.  Whoever was at his door is gone now.  He should feel gratitude.  He should thank the person later and leave it to the imagination why ever for.  As always, he does a cursory inspection and is surprised to find he is whole and all his joints seem to work properly.  Revulsion hits him again and he fends off an image of Lierna torn and bloodied, eaten.  Seen before.  To function, there is a wall he erects against his memory of nightmare, and he does so now.  It will serve until he again sleeps.

He wishes to be still and feign death.  His treacherous body shakes as an aspen leaf shivers in the slightest twist of air, and his back feels as unbending as if he were impaled.  It does not matter now if any of the others live.  He hopes they do not, for it is from here to the cookfires, if the Trollocs are patient enough for cookfires.  Another body rolls into his and he turns to look, eyes glazed as he searches for physical connections.  One hand in the grass, empty, fingers move.  His other hand is around the hilt of a sword or dagger.  A sword.  Pinned under him awkwardly, no movement, and he fears to try to loosen his grip.  A mass of dark hair matted and seeded with sand fills his vision, pale skin under it.  Unnaturally pale.  Drained.
The taloned feet at his side dig into the ground as weight shifts, cartilage grinding against drying dirt, and air moves in a foul, smoky draft trailing a black-beaked head as it swoops down open and buries deeply into the still warm body.  It jerks.  The beak comes up trailing pink and coiling ropes, spraying moisture in a wide spatter.  He gasps and forces his fist behind him several inches along the ground.  A dark and knowing eye connects with his, its flat black wheel of iris constricting on a fathomless pupil.  The Trolloc shakes a massive beak drooping broken innards and dives again, one divided foot rising and planting solidly on his midsection, which does not stop his body's rattling but it does arrest his attempt to wield.
Another sound has intruded, unnoticed until the pulsing grey tones of dream shatter, bringing him into the world halfway, where he hangs and shudders, crying or heaving.  It doesn't matter.  He hates.  As soon as he can move, he is feeling for something to throw, finding nothing edged is of no particular note.  He rolls off his bed to the floor in a half curl, hardly feeling the fall.  Nightmare remains living in him as pain scrapes along his skeleton, wrapping thorny around it and clinging, tangling in nerves.  He can reach the leg of his chair from where he is panting on the floor and he grasps it and lifts it to hurl at the door with all his strength.  The door ceases its unpleasant rapping from the outside as it is pummeled from the inside, a new dent marring the finish as the chair falls and skews to its back.

I fixed the gate for you, and added 90 to your list of editable zones.
I'm not sure why it calls it the 'large' tho, when it's clearly not
the whole desc.  I'll muse on that.

And yeah, outside rooms should be outside, but don't set anything to

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Just for your perusal, and to see if you want to add in the rooms for Valk.

1st Floor:
`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Meeting Room`7 (public, Outer Street to South, Dining Room to East, Training Room to West, Second Floor Hallway to Up)
`7Broad windows at the front of the building let in a great deal of `#l`&ight`7, as well as providing a good view of the street outside and the `1Sau`!c`1y `!Wen`1c`1h`7 across it. There are several small clusters of `3wooden`7 chairs around low tables scattered about the room, apparently set up as places to talk business with the mercenaries of `#H`3eron `8Company`7. A stairway leads from the front of the building up to the second floor at the east side of the room, with another door beneath the stairs leading to the Dining Room. The lone doorway on the west side of the room leads to the Training Room.

`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Dining Room`7 (public, Meeting Room to West, Kitchens to North)
`7This long, low room has a series of `3d`8a`2r`8k `2w`8o`2o`8d`7 tables with benches running alongside. A few round `3tables`7 circled by chairs fill up the empty space along the west wall, and a wide `1f`!i`7r`1e`!p`7l`1a`!c`7e rests at the north end of the room, alongside a door to the kitchens. The door back to the Meeting Room lies on the west wall.

`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Kitchens`7 (public, Dining Room to South, Stables to North)
`7S`8t`&o`7n`8e`7 ovens and heavy `8i`7r`8o`7n stoves line this room, making it warm no matter what time of year it is. By the equipment, smells, and the small amount of food visible when the cooks aren't working, the fare made here tends towards good and solid, with little flare or fancy doings. The door to the south leads into the Dining Room, and another door on the north side of the room leads outside to the Stableyard.

`&The Stables of `#H`3eron `#H`3all`7 (public, Kitchen to South)
`7Behind the three-story building that serves as the headquarters of `#H`3eron `8Company`7 lies an open stableyard almost the same size. A large stable juts off from the main building like the arm of an 'L,' holding the horses of `#H`3eron `8Company`7 in small but comfortable stalls. One can often see small units of mercenaries drilling with pikes or spears in the open space between the stable and the barracks.

`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Training Room`7 (public, Meeting Room to East)
`7This room takes up the majority of the first floor of the building. A few `3wooden`7 pillars are scattered around to support the upper floors, but otherwise the room is completely open. `&C`3a`7n`&v`7a`&s`7 covers the floor, with `!r`1e`!d`7 circles painted on it, and racks of `3lathes`7 and other `&w`7e`&a`7p`&o`7n`&s`7 line the walls. There is a `1f`!i`7r`1e`!p`7l`1a`!c`7e along the west wall to take some of the chill off, but it seems to be rarely used, given how often there are mercenaries practicing their livelihood in the room. There is an ostentatiously large `&lo`7ok`8ing g`7la`&ss`7 along one wall, for practicing forms in front of. The door back to the Meeting Room is in the east wall.

2nd Floor:
`&The Second Floor Hallway`7 (public, Barracks to West, File Leader's Room to South, Volante's room to East, Telen's room to North, Meeting Room to Down, Third Floor Landing to Up)
`7This hallway connects the stairs at the front of the building that lead down to the first floor with the ones at the back of the building that lead up to the top floor. Several `3doors`7 on the west side of the hallway open out into a large barracks, while `3doors`7 on the east side of the hall lead to the individual rooms of the File Leaders. `&W`6i`7ndo`6w`&s`7 at either end of the hallway and `8la`1n`3t`#e`3r`1n`8s`7 between each of the doors keep the place bright day or night.

`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Barracks`7 (public, Second Floor Hallway to East)
`7This cavernous room is filled with double-stacked `3bunks`7, five to a row. There looks to be room for at least a hundred mercenaries to sleep in the room. `1F`!i`7r`1e`!p`7l`1a`!c`7e`1s`7 stand on the west and north ends of the room, and the southwest corner is curtained off by simple `3c`7anva`3s`7 sheets, providing some measure of privacy for the female members of `#H`3eron `8Company`7.

`&A File Leader's Room`7 (public, Second Floor Hallway to North)
`7This small but comfortable room is set aside for the use of one of `#H`3eron `8Company`7's File Leaders. It has a wardrobe and small weapons rack along one wall, a bed along another, and a writing `3desk`7 under a `&w`6i`7nd`6o`&w`7 along a third.

I don't know why it happened, but I was looking over the teleporter

I went into the exits in room 9699 and I picked the east exit, changed

I think there is a PURGE ROOM option, but I thought it would remove
the exit in both directions. I just wanted to disconnect one side of

Anyways, I lost a little bit of work on my teleporters because I hadn't

I personally would rather see AS and WD as a cohesive guild unit.  I think the two work far too closely, and are too inherently linked to operate as separate entities.  That's just my opinion, though, and clearly Balinor - who is the GL - feels otherwise.

I haven't seen him being rude or obnoxious about getting his guild revamped.  If anything, he's been more professional than I would have at first given him credit for.  I think he has a vision for warders that is just different than what we have all grown used to.  Change is scary sometimes and many many people (myself and Maelyn included) are highly resistant to it.  That doesn't necessarily mean that the changes he's making are bad.

I think Maelyn needs to talk to him first before asking us to make him stop.  The two of them -have- to be able to work together, and if the imms come down from on high and make Balinor stop doing what he feels is right for the guild to boost activity and standards, there will be nothing but discontent.  Unless and until we see him doing things that are blatantly against policy or that we can all agree is damaging to the overall functioning of the Tower, I don't see it as our place to stick our noses in.

Do I personally agree with Maelyn?  Yes.  I think Balinor should have left the guilds together and not segregated them.  Do I have any rational reason for that?  Not really: just status quo.  So far, it seems Balinor has brought a lot of vision and drive to the GLship - far more than I would have thought when he was promoted - and I don't really see any reason for US to step in and ask him to stop.  This may all change if/when Maelyn talks to him depending on his reactions to that conversation, but for now, that's pretty much where I'm at.

I don't want to see Maelyn upset because she really is a fantastic AS leader and is good for the guild as a whole, so normally I would be all about doing whatever it takes to make her happy with it, but right now, despite my personal agreement with her on Balinor's actions, I really don't see any way to step in with a clear conscience and force him to change his goals and plans for WD.

Hope that made sense.

I'm not sure how to approach this topic, so forgive me if I seem to ramble a bit. I think 
we each have some very different expectations and assumptions about our roles here, and 
how best to approach them, and in some ways they seem to be at cross purposes, so I 
thought it might be a good idea to get together and find out where we are 
misunderstanding each other. First, let me try to explain what is bothering me. Again, I 
apologize if I am rambling.
    
For many years the WD and AS guilds were separate entities, working together only in 
the academic sense. There was a lot of friction between the groups and the GLs, and it 
translated to a confusing atmosphere for the payers. To improve this, the Tower guild was 
created, and the WD and AS guilds became subgroupings inside that larger umbrella. The 
Tower sometimes had one GL, sometimes 2, and there have been times there have been 
as many as 4 GLS. Most recently, the Tower had Melinda doing it on her own, then 
Samir joined her, then I replaced Melinda, then I handled it by myself for a while. 
Through all those changes we always worked very hard to make sure the guild functioned 
as one cohesive whole. When more than one person was GL, normally one had 
responsibility for one side and one had responsibility for the other, but that was more a 
flexible guideline than a hard and fast rule. In practice, each of us had responsibility for 
the guild as a whole. We talked regularly about what we were seeing and issues that had 
come up, we'd discuss policies and how they needed to change (or remain in effect as the 
case may be), if important decisions came up we would do our best to either discuss them 
together before announcing them, or at least frame them in such a way as to say - this 
may be subject to change once I've had a chance to speak to X, but for now I'd say 
(whatever) if the player/Imm was pressing for an immediate reaction. For Samir and I, 
the way we divided things was - he was the main go to person for WD, I was the main go 
to person for AS, but either of us could do anything in the other's side if needed. We 
were both listed as GLs on every subguild of the Tower, and had every right to do what 
needed doing when the other was not around. To large extent this worked because of the 
high level of trust and communication we had, but the concept was the same as the one he 
and Melinda used, and that previous multiple GL periods had adopted. 
    
After he left and I was the sole GL, the game was fairly slow, and I didn't think it was a 
problem to handle things on my own. It still isn't, but as the player base started to 
increase I began thinking a second GL would have several benefits. First, I am definitely 
NOT an emote fighter and have no skills in teaching that portion of the syllabus. Having 
someone designated for that job would be a great benefit. Second, as much as I do my 
best to be available as much as I can, the truth is that since going back to school I have 
had significant periods when it has been very hard to be here every day, or even every 
week. School is winding down (I am due to finish in June) but that doesn't mean that 
something else might not pop up to take its place. Having a backup for those times would 
be good for the players.  And third, when a difficult issue comes up, it helps to have 
someone that you can talk to about it, get a different perspective, and generally bounce 
ideas off. Now, I  could find a player willing to be an IC MOI to take that part of the job, 
and nothing says I can't talk to various Imms/players I have come to know and trust for 
their opinions if I really needed to do that, and the world will not end if the guild is left 
without me for a few days or a week, but the fact is, I thought it would be easier to see if I 
could enlist the help of a second GL. That's where you came in. My expectations when 
you were given the role was that we would have the same basic framework that Sam and 
I had, with the understanding that it may not work as smoothly or seamlessly until we had 
gotten to know each other's styles and built that level of trust. I expected a transition 
period, but it seems to me, just  based on some of the things you have said and done since 
becoming GL, and a few other things I have noticed, that you had a very different idea of 
what your role would be. From my point of view, it seems you want the AS and WD 
guilds to be separate entities, with the Tower being more a matter for conversational

until you reach the top. 

I didn't want to make any changes without consulting you though.

`7Subj`6:`7 questions on darkfriends' role in a background

`7CC`6: `7Shai'tan Lucardo 

Hello.
There was a question on my background that Syrah said could pass, as it was, only if it was done by a darkfriend/Black Ajah.  So I went with that.  Syrah also noted that since my background included no details of the darkfriend involvement, that if Telen found a clearer memory, I should discuss the details with Maelyn.  It occurred to me that while that was true, I should note the Great Lord of the Dark for permission or advice before speaking with Maelyn.
While in the White Tower for about two years, Telen is angreal/ter'angreal damaged, told it cannot be healed after at least one attempt (which seemed like healing to him) and set out of the White Tower with gold.  I had assumed if a darkfriend did this, one of a few things could or should have happened.  First, if he was damaged, he'd be killed while still at the White Tower.  Second, he would be killed as he left or when he arrived home, southwest of Shol Arbola or in the city where he has relatives.  Since it would be nice if neither of these happened, either the pursuit met with misfortune, or was again delayed for some reason, either to distance a connection to the White Tower or because Telen did not remain in Shol Arbola but traveled with good speed to Caemlyn.
He has been in Caemlyn for several months now.  There was one crazy role-play when he first arrived where someone playing a NPC tried to kill him 'as ordered' but a darkfriend acting like that probably wouldn't have lasted very long serving Shadow.  The NPC was bound by a nearby channeler and turned over to the Queen's guard.  (Oocly, he was incredibly rude to the channeler and might have been removed from the game.)  Third, Telen may have been compelled or otherwise influenced before his release from the White Tower.  If he's going to be pursued and murdered sometime in the future, well, I don't need to know that.  If Shadow has a plausible scenario that allows the background and role-play so far (which includes only the incomplete memory as stated), that would be great.
The reason I would like to know this is that it has come up in role-play that there are new methods of healing at the White Tower.  Before I make something up, I would like to know what responsibility Shadow has for monitoring darkfriend involvement.  Does the Shadow have an opinion on whether Telen might be compelled to stay away? To be silent? Would the Black Ajah be aware of it if he returns and would she care? What other behavior might be instilled?
He is a latent channeler.  The reason for his stay in the White Tower was a Brown Ajah study on wolfkin.  He is not wolfkin, but there were two over the last century in his family.
Thank you for your time.

`7Subj`6:`7 A question regarding Talents
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Syrah,

I play a Recruit, soon to be Soldier of the Black Tower named Etheavin.
According to his background, he comes from a tradition of blacksmiths, and 
is one himself. I am mailing you to ask if I could pursue the Talent of
Power Forging. I know that it is a Lost Talent, and I am not asking for 
you to just give it to me. I am -wanting- to work for this ability, because
it gives me some really great RP opportunities to really flesh out my
character. It is my thought that, since the Black and White Towers are 
working towards an alliance, bringing Etheavin to the White Tower to work
on this with an Aes Sedai would demonstrate a willingness towards cooperation
and allow me to pursue a goal that I don't believe has been explored yet
here on Tyme. 

As I mentioned before, I am not wanting this to just be granted to me for
one reason or another. I am willing to put the time and effort into 
rediscovering this Talent. If this is okay with you, Mail or Tell me, and 
perhaps we can work out the requirements I would have to reach to discover
this Talent for myself. 

Sincerely,
Lila/Etheavin. 

P.S. It might be interesting to discover that Etheavin can only Power Forge
when Linked with an Aes Sedai. If you feel that Power Forging is too strong
for one person to have, this requirement of cooperation would be an interesting
twist to the Talent.

Master Lonaise,

I'm glad to hear that you're still well. I'm trying to convince Rienne to come out to
help pick up the pieces. I think it won't take much more to get her to join me. She's
betrothed to a Lord from Saldaea, and thinks to use that connection to bring Saldaea
and the other Borderlands into the fight against the Seanchan. Hopefully you will get
to meet her soon. I think that you and my Aunt will both enjoy speaking with her.

-Term.

`7Subj`6:`7 Sue's Background
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Sue was a troubled child, even without the stigma attached to his girly
name.  His parents had a very unhappy marriage childhood sweethearts who
found out only after marriage that they really didnt like each other.  His
mother, Amilie, was a seamstress, and his father, Meldan, a soldier.
Amilie tried to run a shop alone while her husband was out guarding things
or out on patrol, only adding to her bitterness that she was the bread-
winner of the family, income-wise, and she worked, at least in her opinion,
much harder than he did.  Meldan died in what was officially called a
training accident while Amilie was pregnant with their first child, and
when the boy was born, she named him after her mother, Susannah, or Sue
for short, mostly to spite the boys father, who always thought that men
should be manly, and wanted Amilie to give up her business so he could be
manly and support her, even if it meant they would live in much less
comfort.

Sue grew up with stories about his father that made him think he was a no-
good drunken lout, among other things.  His mother spoiled him as well, and
the young boy was used to getting what he wanted.  When he was old enough,
his mother decided he needed to learn a trade, like she did, so he could
support himself, and her, when she became too old to continue sewing.  She
found a blacksmith to take in her brat of a son, and had to actually PAY
the blacksmith to keep him on as an apprentice as the boy became gradually
more unruly.  He wasnt used to having to do work.  When he finally learned
enough to start making a bit of money off of his work, she kept whatever
profits were left to repay her for what she spent on his training, after
the Master Blacksmith that Sue was training under took his cut.

Going from a life of relative laziness and luxury to one of hard work for
no pay only made him resent his mother. He vowed to become the best damn
smith in the city, and once he was good enough, he would take his skills
and go elsewhere to practice his trade, so that his greedy mother got none
of HIS profits.

This was not to be, however, since the boy, as he grew up, started to
frequent the taverns with silver he squirreled away before his mother
could get her hands on it, and gained a bit of a reputation for starting
trouble when he got too drunk.

Whatever else he might be, Sue was not stupid, and he saw where his path
was starting to take him.  Deciding he needed to get out of his Mothers
house, and out from under her overbearing skirts, before he got into REAL
trouble, he started looking for a place of his own to live, despite his
relative youth.  He wasn't yet good enough, in his opinion, to open his
own shop and compete against other smiths like his former master, but he
knew that his skills were good enough to get by.  Wanting to ally with
people who would not only appreciate his simple but sturdy workmanship, but
would also give him some REAL power, he started to seek out one of the
Black-Coated men who wander the city, to see if they needed a decent 
blacksmith.  He has no idea that he had the ability to learn to channel,
but he may find that out soon enough.

Telen is convinced he has Termiane's attention before speaking.  He has thought a while on how to say a few things, and now that he has to actually speak a few words in a fairly sensible manner, he cannot recall how he had thought to say them.  No matter.  He will sound like an idiot, and no one will be surprised, least of all himself.  "I had, no I was -" he says and there is a pause where he collects thoughts.  "When I was sick for those weeks, many of the nights, someone was in my room.  I know Renlor stayed there often, and he told me Rhyse was there once, and others visited.  So I survived, and somehow, Renlor did too.  I don't think well when I wake, and when I first took a room at the White Stag, I had to repair the room so often I was told I could either pay more or move out.  I believe about that time, you hired me.  Maybe exactly that time.  So I stayed there.  I am coming to the reason I am mentioning all of this."  Distaste has invaded the neutral expression he maintains when amicability falls flat.
Telen continues, "The brawl in the White Stag either woke me, or I started it, but I recall entering a quiet common room, and trying to stay awake, and then waking and looking for something with an edge to throw.  I did not find anything so I threw the table.  Lifted and kicked it, meaning to hit the fellow in front of me and for no reason.  Since I stopped drinking," and other things, "every morning I would wake up trying for violence, some times worse than others.  I would bar my door from the inside, and that seemed to work well enough."  'Well enough' has the same kind subtle irony in it as 'May the Creator shelter you'.  Like a tar patch on a bucket of coals, or a block of ice set out in the sun to weight a stack of hides.  Sure, that, kind of works.  "On a trip overland, I figured I would be traveling alone and if I tried to put my knife through a tree, well, it might delay me a bit getting it out again, but no great harm done."
"I will control the violence waking, but there is a trade:  I am hard to wake until some hours have passed.  A bit of paste for your face hardly seems worth complaining about, I cannot believe I did it."  The comment gathers weariness and discards it for self-recrimination.  "I can show you how to wake me, but still, there is that, that it might have to be done."  He remembers now he had suggestions on how this might be less of a problem.  They sound incredibly dumb to him now, in retrospect.  It is only what he did in his travel from Arafel to Caemlyn.  Yes, incredibly dumb.  He is lucky he didn't break his neck falling out of a tree.  "If you would like me to find my own way to Bandar Eban, I will do that.  If I am going with you, I need to show you, and the lady Duriel, some few things before we arrive."  Though not necessarily before they leave.  Would be good though.
OOC.. probably best if the RP takes him solo into the west.  I don't want to hold up RP, either, for folks who are on most of the time.

Hey there.  If you want to NPC something meantime, cool.  If not, I can add another short section to this.  Route -overland to Illian, by sea to the west coast.  Guess the borderlander will be learning to sail.
(Description after several weeks of travel:  At his hip is a single straight sword sheathed in a hard scabbard, and directly behind it hangs a long knife with a similarly styled -plain and darkly wrapped-- grip.  Fitted clothing on the moderately tall man makes for a relatively slim silhouette.  His boots are soft-soled and his head is shaved, his eyebrows and lashes bleached a bronze gold by the sun, though it could be assumed the original color was much darker.  His grey eyes have a variegated concentration of color near the rim of the iris that is midnight blue, and charcoal outlines a center of ice.  He is deeply tanned over every inch of exposed skin, and his large hands are calloused with a fine network of odd scarring across the backs.  Determination compresses the set of his mouth and jaw when he is not paying mind to keeping his face impassive.  Heat and cold appear to bother him not at all.)
In a small town south of Caemlyn, between Caemlyn and Illian in a more or less direct route, Telen settles in his rented room and pulls off his shirt to examine his back and shoulders.  The faint ruddiness of sunburn has faded to dull tan, but he removes a jar of oil from one of the few tins he has squirreled, pours a bit out into his palm and rubs it into his skin so that, he hopes, the skin will darken and not peel.  Daily baths are part of his past life, and so with nothing to deliberately remove what he applies, he preserves his scant stores.  If he makes no friends, well, it is a small thing.  He wants none here.
He removes his hat and his braids flop down from their confinement about his skull to fall over his shoulders.  Wasting no time, and thinking nothing of it, he unbinds the ends and unbraids the hair.  It does not have much color in it to his mind.  Like sodden, earthy straw.  He supposes one might call it a medium brown, though the color is odd, he thinks there might be shades of green in it.  Grimacing, he slips his knife from its sheathe at his belt and gathers his hair at the nape of his neck, twists it, places the edge of the knife against the thick column, the spine at his neck, and saws outward.  The hairs part easily but the process takes much longer than he expects.  Loose hair falls forward slowly in a fan, tickling skin.
Hours later, after supper when the evening stretches shadows out from every corner, Telen makes use of a mirror at the end of the upstairs hall of the inn before going into his room.  It is a small mirror, and the frame looks as though it has been secured well to the wood paneled wall.  The silver reflects his image back to him half draped in shadow, but he stares at it, repressing an urge to look behind him.  It isn't Telen, which is good.  The man staring back at him has shoulder length curling hair of some medium color.  It could be dark blond.  His eyes appear pale also, even in the poor lighting.  His skin has an obviously new tan, but he hardly notices such things.  The hair is an unruly mane and he runs both hands through it, bewilderment in wide eyes.  His uneven trimming is hidden by a mass of curl.  Where it all came from, he has no idea.  It was straight before he cut it, and it was straight when he looked at it after he cut it.  It must go.  The bloody mirror shows a fair likeness of a Light-stricken fool poet.  Either that or a child in a man's body.
What is left of his hair in the morning is tucked into his hat, which is short brimmed and of thick leather, black as pitch like the rest of his clothing.  He is not sure what he will do with the clippings.  Leave it in the forest maybe for birds and mice to scavenge for nests.  It felt strange coiled in his hands, like a small, sleek furred animal, warming quickly within his hold.  Hard to describe how he felt without hair that, unbraided, hung below his waist, except lighter somehow.  Somehow being different than literally, lighter, and less impeded with movement of his head and neck.  The town must have a barber or seamstress who would shave his head.  Or he could -his thoughts stumble and halt.  Telen is dead.  What does it matter how he behaves? So long as the goal is served.  As when he said it in Caemlyn, something in him dies a little more.

Hey there.  If you want to NPC something meantime, cool.  If not, I can add another short section to this.  Route -overland to Illian, by sea to the west coast.  Guess the borderlander will be learning to sail.
(Description after several weeks of travel:  At his hip is a single straight sword sheathed in a hard scabbard, and directly behind it hangs a long knife with a similarly styled -plain and darkly wrapped-- grip.  Fitted clothing on the moderately tall man makes for a relatively slim silhouette.  His boots are soft-soled and his head is shaved, his eyebrows and lashes bleached a bronze gold by the sun, though it could be assumed the original color was much darker.  His grey eyes have a variegated concentration of color near the rim of the iris that is midnight blue, and charcoal outlines a center of ice.  He is deeply tanned over every inch of exposed skin, and his large hands are calloused with a fine network of odd scarring across the backs.  Determination compresses the set of his mouth and jaw when he is not paying mind to keeping his face impassive.  Heat and cold appear to bother him not at all.)
In a small town south of Caemlyn, between Caemlyn and Illian in a more or less direct route, Telen settles in his rented room and pulls off his shirt to examine his back and shoulders.  The faint ruddiness of sunburn has faded to dull tan, but he removes a jar of oil from one of the few tins he has squirreled, pours a bit out into his palm and rubs it into his skin so that, he hopes, the skin will darken and not peel.  Daily baths are part of his past life, and so with nothing to deliberately remove what he applies, he preserves his scant stores.  If he makes no friends, well, it is a small thing.  He wants none here.

He sits straight in a ladder back chair with a clean but much stained cloth draped over his bare shoulders.  A handled razor glides over the top of his head gripped securely in the steady hand of a middle aged woman.  Clumps of curling hair slide down his forehead and he blinks and exhales through his nose to ease the tickle and irritation without moving his hands or head.  He has been asked twice to be still, the second time with a vague comment on scarring, and that scars often prevent growth of hair, if he should ever want to grow a full head of hair again.  The razor is dipped and a hand passes over the top of his head as if making way for the blade that follows.
Telen wonders, as he always does, if every man feels that vulnerability of the razor passing the raised veins in one's neck, knowing the blade's edge would cut effortlessly and, as is intended, has been.  He has not found complete trust in any man yet.  Perhaps because he knows how easy it is to betray trust for hidden circumstance.  Things that compromise lurking beneath the skin, untold and maybe unknown, sometimes desperately concealed.  Trust is a fragile thing, and he has found too many ways to gainsay it.  A silvered glass is suddenly in front of his solemn stare, and it takes him a moment to understand why the image staring back at him is so strange.  It is not the lack of hair, it is the lack of color where his hairline begins, where his new tan ends.  The pallor of unearthed grubs on one side of a nearly perfect meeting of gentle arcs, and on the other the glow of gold rich wheat.
He will need to cover his head in decreasing increments to protect the skin that has apparently not seen the light of day for years and years.  He chuckles and thanks the woman heartily, and the glass is removed with a jerk.  Everything is done so, instead of holding himself rigid to disguise the tremor of his body in pain, he is in constant dramatic movement.  Except, as per special request as now, while seated under the light and deft touch of a razor encouraged by coin and perhaps his attitude.  "It is done? I thank you.  And I will pay you, Eilen, as soon as I shake out my purse."  He moves to stand, the first lean forward slow so she might protest if he was to remain still any longer, and then he is pulling off the stained cloth and shaking it on the already strewn floor.  It looks as though several rabbits, the doe brown velvety ones with seal points, have been sheared and then set free to scatter their shorn fur all across the room.
He receives a narrow glance and the cloth is snatched out of his grasp, which becomes loose to allow its swift retrieval.  "You do no have to fill the air with your scruff, bad enough it will take weeks to clean it out of the floorboards."  The chiding is ignored.  Telen would offer to clean the room spotless and then begin doing it.  He will not.  He smiles what he knows is engagingly and nods, "Twill remind you of me when I'm gone, that cannot be a bad thing."  He is already stepping out of reach of the cloth as it snaps toward him, throwing another cloud of hairs into the still, almost tepid, air.  "Just you be sure to pay what you owe me."  Of course he will.  He does.
After another several days of travel, his life and identity change once more.  Land or sea, the decision is allowed to haunt him for a day only, and then made for him, as it often is, by someone, or Something, more purposeful.

It is only after several minutes have passed and he seems to have finished his own

I used downloaded the episodes to my computer using bittorrent technology.
And then watched the file(s) on VLC Player.

Step by step:

1. Download VLS Player. It can play any videofile. :) http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
2. Download a bittorrent program. The official one is pretty easy to use and understand, http://www.bittorrent.com/download
3. This is the hardest part. Use a torrent tracker site such as www.mininova.org and searh for Drive. Click on the TV Shows tab.
That'll sort out any irrelevant searches. Then find your episode. In your case it's probably episode 3 of season 1.
Make sure the file sizes are ca 350mb (normal for 1 hour shows). Then make sure that the file has a lot of seeders (those sharing)
preferably over a few hundred.
Then you click on that file and then click on "Download this torrent". If you've installed your torrent program, then
you'll automatically be told to open the file using that program. Do it. And then decide where to save the file.

Speed of download depends on your connection and the number of seeders/leechers.
And for other shows/movies/etc...just repeat step 3. :P

-Current assignment: None.
-Last assignment: None, due to timeline changes and Jai's DF status flipflopping.
-Greatest Accomplishment: Not dying? :P Jai's only been a DF for a short RL time,
ICly only about 50 years. She's very good at rumormongering, so chances are, her
greatest thing has something to do with that.
Current Connections: Close friend of Kinje (he's the one that convinced her to go dark),
the rest have either been reset with timeline changes, or they no longer play.

Lasaria
-Current assignment: Making trouble, more or less. HoF is supposed to be targetting
certain people, but they've more or less left the game (Jerod).
-Last assignment: The capture and retrieval of the Hand of Fear, as well as a certain
Aes Sedai (Sabrina/Jezz). The two have been running amok together ever since, though
Sabrina tends to run off without Lasaria and be much more ... obvious ... than Lasaria
prefers.
-Greatest accomplishment: Succeeding at her last assignment and not dying in the process.
-Current Connections: She has connections with Kinje and Turel, neither can really be called
a "friend" but they're both the closest thing she has to a friend. Sabrina is a common
cohort in crime, but their relationship is sort of a love/hate one. (none of Sabrina's
personalities are all that fond of the HoF, but the HoF absolutely adores all of them...
in a very bizzare way... it's amusing.)

Dropped dead creatures from the Blight into the local wells. Wasnt so much an assignment, as a vendetta against Caemlyn.  Esrahd was exiled from Caemlyn. 

`0-Your greatest accomplishment for the Shadow.
`8Brought Jasmyn's sister and warder to the shadow. Was the single most awesome RP I have ever done. Raeyenia (sp?) no longer has a pinky toe. :P
 
`0-Your current connections (if any) to other Darkfriends, especially any that might have reason to dislike you. This includes NPCs.
`8None that I can think of.

This is going to be fairly simple:

I have no shadow assignment.
I haven't had any shadow assignments.
My greatest accomplishment for the Shadow: Nothing really
in this timeline because Isleen's status has still to be
discussed with a shadow imm.
Isleen has connections to Kinje and Sabrina.  None of
them really know each other's status.  They just know
each other, and are wary around one another, because none
of them know who of them has the most rank in the Shadow. :P

  Okay, so let me explain.  I sent in an app for Isleen,
which Lucardo said was okay, and then Shai'tan told me
that most of what I wanted in my background wasn't going
to be allowed, but wouldn't tell me what -would- be okay.
So I kind of just gave up playing Isleen, because it was
a bit discouraging that a.) the Shadow has been so disorganized
and b.) first I was approved, then I wasn't.
  So I suppose what I could do is send you my original
background and let you look it over.  Basically, I had
wanted Isleen to be trained by Lanfear.  Maybe have one or
two spiffy weaves.  But apparently that's asking for the
moon, so I suppose I'll have to re-write it. :)

  Let me know what I should do.  I really do like this
character, and would like to get her active again.

"It is good that you will recommend her. I will do so as well, when the time comes." Sadren brushes her dress down, smoothing a few wrinkles out as she does. "The position is one that I did not have to offer, Narissa, but one that I think is important. Both of our Ajahs value knowledge.. a History concerning the Formation of the Black Tower will be of utmost importance for future generations." Sadren is quiet for a moment, her cold, doe brown eyes, staring at Narissa with indifference. "But it is a position I established, and one that I will be forced to sacrifice for. Nothing will be asked of the Brown Ajah, but much will be asked of me." She blinks, placing a hand on her pregnant belly. "As far as Matylena goes.. It is likely that she will be chosen. And Iam working to have as many Ajahs behind her as possible when the time comes. A unified Tower is more important than anything else, Narissa. You should know this."  [Sadren]

Can you tell me if I understand what a linker is properly?

I am reading that there is object code (code which has been
compiled) and functions (which perform needed tasks).

If you use functions in your programs, then the linker
takes the object file and combines it with the object
code to create the executable file.

So, it takes the two different portions of your code,
the object and the fucntion, and links them together
so that they work properly, yes?

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
I think that we should focus on building areas for the areas we
intend to have RP. Right now, our RP is focused in Tar Valon, 
Caemlyn, and Seanchan (Tanchico).

We have a Cairhien in, but not much RP happens in that area.

I had an Aiel Waste built, but it is gone. No idea what happened
to it. I think some zones that we should definitely have since
we are getting a fight code in would be the Blight, for very
difficult monsters, the Waste, also for difficult monsters,
and the Shaido Hold in the wetlands, again, for hard monsters to
fight. 

I don't really know if we need to have many more zones put in
because we don't have a population to sustain their use. However,
if we get people in certain guilds that would require an area, 
I'd have no problem seeing one put in. 


What else would you like concerning building? Just let me know what
kind of information you'd like, and I'll find it. 

Going to look up EQ stuff right now, but I have to wade through
all of the boards to find it.

Hey Sadren,

No problem.  Are you enjoying the new job? :p

As far as the EQ goes, Cormac drew up the numbers that are posted on the builders board.
I guess the big thing would just be to do some spot checking and make sure all the eq in
those zones are finished.  They may very well be finished already.

Also, if you have time, check out the craft code on builderport, and make sure that it creates objects properly.

Aside from objects, I think the only thing holding me back on combat code is forms, which Parol has 
promised he will get started on as soon as he gets back from his trip.

Hopefully we can get things moving again.

Most of the stuff on the BD board should already be built.

They are all in zone 37 I think, that's all the new stuff.  So
it should mostly be an issue of going over what's there, figuring out what

Please let me know if it might be possible to e-mail me the world (.wld) and zone (.zon) files for this area.

I'm going to be setting the prices rather low, unless

`7Date`6:`7 Thu Jul 26 11:51:15 2007
`7From`6:`7 Volkare
`7Subj`6:`7 Background for Liahm Dalren
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
I'm not looking for inclusion of Liahm (my rename for Volkare) in the DD guild (I think
there are too many Asha'man there already), just looking to get approval for the bits
of the background that touch on DD subjects (service with House Tarborwin).

Liahm Dalren was never satisfied with his life. The first child of a minor 
Cairhienin merchant, he was trained from a young age to take over his father's 
business, and so he spent from age 6 to age 13 drearily behind a desk, learning 
to balance ledgers and follow trading trends. His mother, a seamstress by 
trade, always told the most amazing stories of adventure and travel, much at 
odds with the boring life that Liahm was quickly growing into. His younger 
sister had to learn as well, but she wasn't pushed as much as Liahm by their 
father. The situation quickly grew to grate on the young boy, and he ran off, 
hitching his fortunes to a passing menangerie. Running messages and tending to 
props wasn't much more exciting, but at least he was around exciting people, 
and constantly moving through new lands. 

He lasted four years with the menagerie, and then found himself back in 
Cairhien, bored to tears of mucking out stalls and no closer to performing in 
any way, shape, or form. By this time, his mother and father were dead (she 
grew sick shortly after he fled home, he passed on shortly after she did) and 
his sister had been taken away to Tar Valon (the loss of the second child was 
what pushed his mother over the edge). With nothing of his family left, Liahm 
swore himself to House Tarborwin as a guardsman, sure that this was the way to 
glory, adventure, and excitement. And in a way, he was right.

His training progressed rapidly enough, as the young man was used to physical 
exertion, and learned quickly, and soon he was a newly minted Guardsman of 
House Tarborwin. He served the House for several years, skirmishing against 
Andorans and Tairens before he was 20 and the world changed. Aiel poured over 
the Dragonwall again. Liahm fought with the rest of his House, doing what he 
could to save the city of his birth. The intervention of the Lord Dragon and 
his Aiel undoubtedly saved the young Guardsman's life, and Liahm was left to 
help his House rebuild in the wake of the war.

Then the Lord Dragon was taken from the very Sun Palace, and Liahm, now a 
Squadman, was chosen to accompany Lord Dobraine to succor the Savior of 
Cairhien. He fought long and hard, seeing the devastation wrought by women who 
could channel. That wrath was surpassed as the sun outshines a candle by the 
fury of the black-coated men who arrived and ended the battle. Then and there, 
Liahm Dalren decided that he would serve the Lord Dragon whose subjects had 
saved him twice now. On the first recruiting trip to Cairhien, the young man 
made himself available to the Asha'man, his awe of the black-coated 
slaughterers overshadowing his family's particular fear and hatred of male 
channelers. Expecting to be shunted aside to train the Legion of the Dragon, 
Liahm was surprised and frightened when it was found that he could learn to 
channel.

He was taken to the Farm just weeks after the battle of Dumai's Wells, and 
there his true training began. Crispness and precision marked the young 
Cairhienin's style, although now and then hints of the showmanship learned with 
the menagerie showed through. He quickly became a Soldier, and his strength and 
ability with the One Power marked him for quick promotion, and he quickly 
became a specialist in combating other channelers. It was his loyalty to Mazrim 
Taim, however, that gained him the sword pin of a Dedicated, and sent him to 
the White Tower in the Raid. He was one of the men who Traveled into the Ajah 
Halls, and he spent the entire duration of the Raid subduing recalcitrant Aes 
Sedai with all indication of great enjoyment.

Although his sense of adventure chafes at the forced inactivity at the Black 
Tower, he trains for the day when the Aes Sedai once more decide that they are 
more important than the Asha'man, fully intending to put them back in their 
place (beneath the polished boots of the Asha'man, in his mind) when that day 
comes. How this belief will change when it becomes apparent that his sister 
Kadiana, now an Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah, is at the Black Tower is yet to be 
seen.

Check the new bug I listed under the bug command. 

Also, Esrahd said he completed a Warder Tower. Is there
anyway to check and see where this zone went? I don't see
it in our current zones. I know that I had an Aiel Waste,
also, but I can't find that zone either, or Ethrea's Fal
Moran. 

Anyway we can salvage these zones? It would save quite a bit
of time, and keep me from redoing several areas.

Hey guys,

Any other coments or ideas before I go and repost this? Anything
I can add to make it better?

******************************************************************

A Moment in Tyme (MiT) is one of the oldest Wheel of Time 
based Muds on the Internet.  Since 1994, our coders and 
builders have been working hard to bring in unique new 
features and our own original areas.  MiT is currently on 
our third major revision of the codebase, and our areas 
are all completely original.  At A Moment in Tyme, we have 
a dedicated playerbase and an excellent, committed staff of 
Immortals.  We have unique systems in place to rank 
players' mastery in swordplay and channeling (Wheel of 
Time's magic system).
 
A Moment in Tyme is set on a Timeline that is based on the
first six books. After that, though, Tyme has broken away
to become a mirror world of those books. The Bowl of the Winds
has been found and used, breaking the long winter. Elayne
has returned to Andor and taken the Throne. After the death
of Queen Analinde Su Riaten Rie, Lord Dobraine of House 
Taborwin acts as Cairhien's Regent.
 
The White Tower split pit Sister versus Sister, but an attack 
from the Black Tower resulted in Elaida's kidnapping and
subsequent desposing. Now, the White Tower stands united
against the coming of Tarmon Gaidon, with Matylena Taravin
presiding as the new Amyrlin. She has named the Rand al'Thor
as the Dragon Reborn, and there is talk of cleansing the Taint.
 
And the Seanchan? Tarabon, Arad Doman, and Altara are
all victims of the Ever Victorious Army. The High Lady
Suroth invaded, and conquered Murandy, instead of reaching
into Amadicia. Because of this, High Lady Ilorin Shayndel 
Paendrag, fourth in line for the Crystal Throne, has 
officially settled into the Panarch's Palace and taken
control of the Hailene. Who will stop them? Word is that 
a mercenary group called the Heron Company is being raised
to retake Arad Doman...
 
A Moment in Tyme is a RP-intensive MUD that features over
twenty guilds. On this MUD, experience is received
exclusively for roleplaying based on emotes. Combat code
is currently being remodified and rebuilt from the ground
up, and will offer a system based on 50 different body 
parts as well as have very realistically coded forms with 
special procedures.

Hey, Sadren and Balinor said he'd been set up to build, but didn't have a zone.
I went ahead and allocated zone 98 as the warder zone, since apparently that's
what he's going to be working on, and gave him access to it.  That work?

No worries at all. I've been scarce myself. 

I threw together a quick plaza description because I updated the zone,
and added about twenty or thirty descs and I didn't want that to
remain empty. 

However, the Healing Halls still need to be desced. :D I would
love it if you could do it, when you get around to it. 

Also, do you remember at all where the old Warder Tower was? What
year was it b uilt in, what zone, or was it part of the Tower? Any
idea at all? Because I have access to the old zone files, and I can
search for it. If you remember any roomnames, or a line in any of
the descs, that can help me search for it. 

Thanks!

The combat code you currently see is not what we're working on.  It was someone
elses failed attempt to build a turn based combat system.  However it lacks
all of the basic features of our new system.  The whole grid system is going away
also, because it prevents combat use with mobs.

Don't hesitate to let us know about any other MUD features that are not accessible,
and if you're around when we open the new code for beta testing, be sure to sign up
and test it out for us.  :)

`7Subj`6:`7 Asha'man
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
A slender young man with a set of slightly narrowed light brown eyes framed in a smooth, almost silky face were it not for a slight tan. Clean cheeks meet a 
slim nose, all set above an oval shaped jaw.
Background
Dawynn staggered to his knees, head ringing and blood trickling down his temples. Not his blood, was it? His eyes darted around the tent, colorful spots 
blinking in and out of his vision. A painting hung from the southern entrance, depicting a disproportionaly large man in the lookout post of a small vessel, 
floating in the sky with a hand pointing towards something afront, in the distance. Ironically, the man's head had been pierced by a stray piece of wood. The 
room was covered in dirt and... and blood. A gaping hole in the tent wall revealed the street and the burning tents across.
Alarming shouts and the sound of thunder and ringing of steel foreshadowed the sight that was about to meet Dawynn. Flinching, he stood up and covered the 
five paces of ground that lead out to the large, gaping hole and the street. The large pool of smeared blood that lead to the street looked as if someone had 
crawled or been dragged across, out of the hole into chaos while bleeding profously. His eyes darted across the ground outside the tents in the Shaido camp 
and he saw men lying about, groaning in pain at the loss of limbs or holes torn up by the ball of flame that had hid the tent. He winced, seeing his uncle 
lying with stumps where there had been legs, clothes charred and turning into ashes.
 He did not have time to mourn. He needed to run, right this instant. He 
tossed away the white garnments of gai'shain and scurried about, looking for clothes. He would not be made an Aiel slave again.
Dawynn is a Tar Valoner orphan who grew up in the care of his uncle, Hamin. His uncle was a merchant of sorts, serving as a middle-man, or as he himself 
preferred to call it, 'the vital link between the interest and the interested'. In his company, he grew up on the roads, travelling along the trade-routes by 
road from Cairhien in the east to Arad Doman in the East. He had seen a lot of interesting things in the world but never quite felt at ease not having a 
home. At one point, when he was 12, they stayed in Tar Valon for more than two years, which was the longest 
he had ever stayed in a single place. His uncle 
took good care of him, as well as he could considering he was not very wealthy and could not settle down in a place long enough. His bargain with two 
merchants from Two Rivers who would sell him their acquired tobacco in Tar Valon ensured that he could stay in Tar Valon for those two years, finally 
granting Dawynn and opportunity to sleep under the same roof.
The boy though, never felt that being sedentary granted him any special sense of belonging. His home was simply someplace else, with someone else, and he 
never found himself being like the next person. He always had questions, as if there should be more to life than existing, that in these times, turning 
increasingly menacing every year, there was some place out there where he could do something extraordinary. On their way from Malden, the town was overtaken 
by Shaido and him and his uncle were forced to become gai'shain. Not long after, the Shaido suffered a terrible defeat and Dawynn fled along with others, 
making his way to Lugard, where he is at present.
(Hoping to be picked up by a recruiting crew of Asha'man)

Description

A short man maybe five feet seven inches tall with dark hair and eyes stands here.
He is a stocky man with a nice build, by his looks you may say he is in his late twenties.
He features are fair, delicate, yet handsome. He bears a small scar above his left eye. His
eyes are a deep dark brown and hair deep brown as well almost mistaken for black. His
looks are very normal to say he is of Cairhienin descent, other than the style of his hair
From the looks of him it seems he hasn't had to do much hard work, don't let that fool
you. From the look of his smile and eyes you know how cunning and strong this man
really is.

He wears a silk loose fitting black shirt and dark blue fancy wool trousers. Over
his shirt he wears an black leather vest, starting from the neck of the vest to the
bottom small blue and white strips run across one after the other, covering the
front of it. Over all of this he wears a very nice fitted white wool coat that he keeps
open usually. Ivory cuff-links in the easily recognizable shape of a Rising Sun adorn
his wrists. There is also a well made stitching of a Rising Sun sewn into the left
breast of the coat, made well for good view of the eye. His boots are a highly
polished black leather they come up to just above the ankle. Around his waist is a
polished black leather belt with a white ivory buckle. From the belt hangs three
sheaths one for a sword the other for two daggers. The short sword has a silver handle
with black leather braided in a fancy design around it, the blade is curved and single
fancy design around it, the blade is straight and double edged. The other dagger has a
edged. One dagger has a white ivory handle with black leather braid in another 
clear almost crystal handle and double edged curved blade.

A short man maybe five feet seven inches tall with dark hair and eyes is here.
He is a stocky man with a nice build, by his looks he is in his late twenties.
He features are fair, delicate, yet handsome. He bears a small scar above his left eye. His
eyes are a deep dark brown and hair deep brown as well almost mistaken for black. His
looks are very normal it may be safe to say he is of Cairhienin descent, other than the style of his hair.

He wears a silk loose fitting white shirt and fancy dark blue wool trousers. Over
his shirt he wears an black leather vest. Over all of this he wears a very nice
fitted black wool coat that he keeps open usually. Ivory cuff-links in the easily
recognizable shape of a Rising Sun adorn his wrists. There is also a well made design
of a Rising Sun sewn into the left breast of the coat, made well for good view of the
eye. On his head he wears a well made flat blue velvet hat. His boots are highly
polished black leather they come up to just above the ankle. Around his waist is a
polished black leather belt with a white ivory buckle. From the belt hangs three
sheaths one for a sword the other for two daggers. The short sword has a silver handle
with black leather braided in a fancy design around it, the blade is curved and single
fancy design around it, the blade is straight and double edged. The other dagger has a
edged. One dagger has a white ivory handle with black leather braid in another
fancy design around it, the blade is straight and double edged. The other dagger has a
clear almost crystal handle and double edged curved blade.

Bakur wants to take a trip the Caemlyn to look around and listen, or better yet snoop. He wants to see what other Houses in Andor are up to any tips would serve useful as knowledge. It is mainly just a little vacation to learn new things, meet new faces, or hear news.

With a sense of dread building in her gut, Myrene immediately left
Maradon in the wake of the horsemen. My noon, she was nearly back to
Jambal when the same horsemen appeared in the distance. Hiding low in
the shrubbery along the roadside, she watched as they returned toward
Maradon. The barding and coats of the lighter horses were stained
red. When she arrived back at Jambal sometime after noon, it was to
a scene of horror. Several houses had been burnt to the ground, their
cinders still glowing and smoking. The bodies of several villagers
were lined up at the center of town. They had been slaughtered. The
rest of that day is a misty blur to Myrene: she has never been able to
fully remember what happened next.


What she does know is the outcome of that day and her decisions. Within
the week, the townsfolk had come to blame her for the slaughter of the
townspeople. By stealing back the ice peppers, she had inadvertently
been reported. The innkeeper who had given her the tip had immediately
dispatched a messenger to the Nataraja estate informing them of her
presence. The horsemen had headed west at first light once it was
determined that someone had stolen the ice peppers, and an example was
to be made. However, the townsfolk stood their ground and several of
the House Guard of Nataraja became unruly. A fight had broken out
and the aftermath was what Myrene had stumbled upon.
The townsfolk found Myrene to be the culprit and exiled her from Jambal.
Although her parents pleaded for mercy for their child, the townsfolk
would have nothing of it. Cutting her from brow to cheek, she was marked
as a fugitive and cast out. That day, she learned what it was to truly
be on her own.
Over the course of the next twenty years, she slowly made her way south
from town to town performing simple tasks for those who needed help.
However, she kept out of the sight of most public areas due to her
poorly-healed scar, and was therefore considered something of a hermit
and charlatan. Tales arose over time that she was everything from Aes
Sedai to Shadowspawn. Each time such rumors reached her ears, she would
travel on to the next town before her welcome was worn out. By her
fortieth naming day, Myrene found herself in Salidar. There, she finally
made a name for herself as a seamstress, and the people accepted her
without fear.

Shortly after her fifty-second naming day, the Aes Sedai began to appear.
First, there were no more than a handful. But each day, several more
arrived. Over the course of the next month, it became apparent that
something major had occured within the White Tower. The few residents of
Salidar who hadn't yet fled whispered of a breach within the Aes Sedai,
and that a new Amyrlin was to be chosen. Shortly after the arrival of
the last Aes Sedai, Myrene was taken in as a secretary to a Red Sister
named Demene Tarandrelle. That day, it was discovered that Myrene was
not just a seamstress, but a channeler as well. Under the supervision of
Demene, Myrene Narashdamani became one of the first Novices taken in
by the Rebels, despite her age. In fact, two weeks later, a woman several
decades older, Sharina Malloy, became a Novice as well.

Currently, Myrene Narashdamani is within the Rebel's camp along with the
other Novices recruited during their travels.

Wonderful background, excellent job, I only saw one thing that needs
correcting, and need one clarification. The coorection is - Salidar
was abandoned for 40 years before the AS showed up. They chose it 
because it was empty, and so they could gather in relative obscurity.
Myrene can be a seamstress in a town maybe a dozen miles away, and 
rumors of a gathering of people in the abandoned town can draw her to
Salidar where she can get the job as secretary,
The clarification is - she is a woman who has the ability to learn, but
will not channel unless taught, correct? How far did she get in her
training with the rebels?
That's it! Let me know and we'll talk about how to make you all
official and stuff.

`7CC`6: `7Matylena Balinor 

Just a quick note - In New Spring (Practice) Moraine is thinking about
the Tower's numbers. There is room for 200 Accepted and 400 Novices
and she knows that there was a time that both Accepted and Novices
bunked two to a room. That isn't done in the books present time
because there is no need. Even with every girl having her own room 
there are far more empty rooms than occupied. In Tyme, we have had
the Novices bunk two to a room for some time now, mainly to give
the Novices a 'freind' to rp with when the AS aren't around. It helps
new players feel more connected to the guild. I've tried (not always
successfully) to put less experienced players with more experienced ones
as roomies when I could, also to help the newbies get settled. Then, 
when they move to Accepted, they get a private room and it seems like
more of a perk because they no longer have to share and aren't as
cramped. In my mind, Novice beds are slender, cot size things. Two
in a room is crowded, but the Novices are kept too busy to spend much
non-sleeping time there. The Accepted beds are larger, and therefore
feel more luxurious to them, another way of rewarding them for making
it to that level.

Anyway, all that is just to say, even if he had 800 coming here, we 
could house them with little effort. It is only the army that concerns
me, and I agree with much of your thinking Maty. Billet them in the
bridge towns and the city. Move them to forts when we can. I think
that would work. And, I also agree that since weevils and rot have
not been a problem in game, food should not be a huge problem. I do
think we will need to increase the supplies coming in, but that should
not be impossible to do. The Tower has stores of food kept fresh with
wards, so we have quite a bit all ready. Increase the trade, and we 
should be fine. I don't think it should be a ho-hum whatever kind of
thing, but I don't think it will lead to mass starvation or anything like
he is talking about. Maybe some items will become more scarce or
expensive, but nothing like Great Depression bread lines.

Its too bad we don't have a merchants guild anymore. We could generate
some rp with them and work out trade agreements  :)

Thanks for the correction! I totally spaced that Salidar was empty.
I just remembered reading about Egwene's string of maids that were
local girls and assumed they had lived there longer than the Aes
Sedai. I guess it's time for a re-read. ^_^ I think the idea
of her being from a nearby town should work just fine. Being
a seamstress for a town of clothes-loving Aes Sedai would be
more profitable than her local yokel job, definitely, and
would make sense ICly for her.

As for the clarifications:
* Myrene is a latent channeler, not a wilder
* She was written into the Rebel's "novice book"
  just before they started their journey northeast.
* To make guild lessons fair, I've decided that she hasn't
  had any lessons in the One Power yet. So far, her previous
  mentors have only helped her try to embrace saidar with
  no success so far (she's a slow learner :P) so that I can
  RP out all the good lessons still.

I guess that's it. If you need anything else, just send me

Heya Duren,

However, this is an IMP only command. I'm not godly enough

Would you mind creating zone 4? Name is Sadren's Zone,
I will be able to handle it from there.

Will there be a way to somehow organize automated quests so that Imms can see them?

This is a very low priority, but I just want a way to somehow keep track of quests.
Perhaps by zone, or something?

Ok, I'm a little confused by this.  Do you mean listing the mob-progs?  Wouldn't
that be, mpstat, mpdump, mproglist, etc?

Or am I missing something?

Ok, I finally fixed mpedit list so it always lists in sequential order from lowest to highest.
I also made it so you can type:  mpedit list [zone] and see only the programs in that
zones range of vnums (Note that this command works regardless of whether a zone with
that number really exists or not, because mob programs aren't actually tied to zones
in any way.)

Also, my new creation system here is almost finished, and is mostly working, so you shouldn't
have any trouble creating new characters now.

Also, I updated the help files (MPEDIT, MOBPROGRAMS, and added a new one:  MOB LOGIC)
The MOB LOGIC file contains a reference for how to use the if-else statements, as well
as examples, and also includes a reference for how to use the for-loop code I created.

I believe that takes care of all your requests regarding mob progs so far.  :)

Hey Sadren,

I deleted your latest task on dotproject.  Before you go and get upset, here's why:

1.)  We already have said RP log system.  We've had it for years, just no-one uses it.
2.)  I already have a task on the dotproject board about revamping the RP log system to make it even more feature-complete.

Also, I made another very significant improvement to the mob program code.  You know
how before it would respond immediately to events?  So if you were following someone
and you followed someone into a room, the mob would greet him before you made it into
the room, so you never saw the first greeting?

Well, I changed all that.  Now when an event occurs, it gets added to a list.
And then after all players commands have been processed, the mud goes through
this list, and processes all the events in the order they were received.
Now as part of this same code, I added a delay variable, so each event can
have a different delay.  The delay being how long it will sit in that events
list before it executes.  This also allowed me to create an even better way
of handling delays than with mob pause.

Remember I said mob pause actually leaves your script in memory, and your script just calls the
main game loop a given number of times (depending on how long you delay) ?
So here's what happens:

game_loop calls command_interpreter (Lets say command is 'east' and you walk into a mob)
   command_interpreter calls move_character function (to move you 'east'
      move_character checks for mob triggers, finds one, and calls mp_greet_trigger
         mp_greet_trigger calls program_flow, to execute your script.
            program_flow executes your script, encounters a 'mob pause' and begins calling game_loop
               game_loop goes through and processes any pending character commands and output.  However, anything the original game_loop was working on (Such as processing people who are following you) won't be taken care of by this game loop.
Notice now we have two game_loops, and when someone else types a command, we'll have two instances
of command_interpreter, and then that may cause another mob trigger, which will cause another instance
of program_flow, and that second script may have a delay in it as well.  And now we have another copy
of game loop running while we wait for that delay.  -Plus-, the original program_flow now has to wait
for the second one to finish before it can ever regain control.  So if player A triggers a 5 second
mob pause delay, and Player B triggers a 30 second delay while program A is in the process of
it's 5 second delay, then player A will end up waiting over 30 seconds, because he has to wait for
the second program to finish (Even if it's in another room or zone).

Basically, even though it's better than the original delay code, it's
still far from ideal.  My new code fixes all this.

I introduced a new command, called 'halt'  It works just like mob pause, only
better.  So you can do 'halt 5', to interupt your program for half a second.
The halt command actually saves all the data about where the script was when it stopped,
and then adds an event onto that events buffer I added, setting the delay for whatever you
specify.  Then once that delay is up, the MUD will re-open the script, jump back to where
it left off, and resume execution from that point.

So halt is definitely the preferred way to pause programs now.

I also changed mprogadd so it expects a delay variable now.  If you want the mob
to continue responding instantly to an event, without ever going on the event list,
you can specify a -1.  You will need to use -1 for some scripts, such as if you want
to have a script that only blocks an exit under certain rules.  If you use the 
event buffer, your script won't end before the move_character code needs to know whether
or not you used 'end' or 'end 1'.  So it will assume you just did a regular 'end' and block
the character.

Alright, now next topic.  Brailon sent me a mudmail offering to help build some.  He's
built before but he's probably a little rusty on the commands.  I'll forward the mudmail to you and syrah.

Hey Sadren,

I deleted your latest task on dotproject.  Before you go and get upset, here's why:

1.)  We already have said RP log system.  We've had it for years, just no-one uses it.
2.)  I already have a task on the dotproject board about revamping the RP log system to make it even more feature-complete.

Also, I made another very significant improvement to the mob program code.  You know
how before it would respond immediately to events?  So if you were following someone
and you followed someone into a room, the mob would greet him before you made it into
the room, so you never saw the first greeting?

Well, I changed all that.  Now when an event occurs, it gets added to a list.
And then after all players commands have been processed, the mud goes through
this list, and processes all the events in the order they were received.
Now as part of this same code, I added a delay variable, so each event can
have a different delay.  The delay being how long it will sit in that events
list before it executes.  This also allowed me to create an even better way
of handling delays than with mob pause.

Remember I said mob pause actually leaves your script in memory, and your script just calls the
main game loop a given number of times (depending on how long you delay) ?
So here's what happens:

game_loop calls command_interpreter (Lets say command is 'east' and you walk into a mob)
   command_interpreter calls move_character function (to move you 'east'
      move_character checks for mob triggers, finds one, and calls mp_greet_trigger
         mp_greet_trigger calls program_flow, to execute your script.
            program_flow executes your script, encounters a 'mob pause' and begins calling game_loop
               game_loop goes through and processes any pending character commands and output.  However, anything the original game_loop was working on (Such as processing people who are following you) won't be taken care of by this game loop.
Notice now we have two game_loops, and when someone else types a command, we'll have two instances
of command_interpreter, and then that may cause another mob trigger, which will cause another instance
of program_flow, and that second script may have a delay in it as well.  And now we have another copy
of game loop running while we wait for that delay.  -Plus-, the original program_flow now has to wait
for the second one to finish before it can ever regain control.  So if player A triggers a 5 second
mob pause delay, and Player B triggers a 30 second delay while program A is in the process of
it's 5 second delay, then player A will end up waiting over 30 seconds, because he has to wait for
the second program to finish (Even if it's in another room or zone).

Hey Syrah,

I need some help on a big project. I am trying to fix up
the newbie zone.. I intend to make an actual zone, but
it will be a huge work in progress.

Before I do that, I want to fix the zone we have now. Just
update the typos and make certain that the rooms are all
updated as far as the information goes. You know a great
deal about MUD policy, which is why I approached you
about this.

If you have extra time, do you think you could help
with this? I would be immensely greatful. I'm starting
to get pulled in different directions, and I can't
seem to get any one project done.

If you do have time for this, it's the newbie walkthrough
just down of recall. If you wander the area on BP, you
can just leave stickynotes of things that need to be
updated (and if you REALLY love me, any typoes you see)
and I will go through when you are done and do all the
actual work.

I'd really appreciate anything you can offer. :D

I need someone to code a flag so that players may sit ON objects, such as chairs, fountains, benches, etc.
 
I also have an idea for mobscripts that will require and make use of being able to set objects ON object. This will require two things:
 
One is the SIT flag. Any objects with a SIT flag can be sat upon, such as a fountain, a chair, a bench, a couch, etc.
 
Also, I will need an ON flag. Any objects with an ON flag will be able to have other objects sat on top of them. I need this ON flag so that I can create quests where I put objects ON other objects to create some desired effect.
 
Also, there needs to be some sort of way that objects can be both SIT and ON. However, if objects are ON another object, then PCs should not be able to sit on them. They should receive a message saying, "There is already something on the bench/chair/fountain, etc."

This is a list Duren gave me of things which would have to be updated in order to complete this task.
  
Duren:
At a high level, we need:
*Two new object flags.
*We need two new linked lists on objects, one to store players who are sitting on an object, and another to store objects that are sitting on an object.
*We need to modify the 'sit' command to allow sitting 'on' something.
*We need to modify the 'put' command to allow putting stuff on other things.
*We have to modify commands like 'look', to make them display people or objects that are sitting on an object.
*And then we have to deal with code that expects all objects to be either in the room, or in an object in the room. All of that code will have to be modified to now search -on- objects as well as -in- objects.

Okay, I've figured it out. Here are the steps:

1. Choose the exit you want to make into a door
2. Choose option 3 to name the door with "door <direction>"
3. Choose option 5 for "Door Flags"
4. Set it to option 1 "Closeable Door"
5. Back at the door options editor, it should now say
   "Is a door"
6. Exit out of the editor and make sure to save as you leave
7. Close the door manually once out of the editor
8. Redit save <zone>
9. Zedit save <zone>
10. Zreset <zone>

You  can not  quite put an age  to this woman.   At one moment she seems a
youthful 20,  the next she seems older,  wiser, perhaps 50.  She stands at
a willowy five foot eight and moves with a natural grace, as if each step,
each action  were part of  a well planned dance.   Long,  glistening locks
of honey-blonde hair flow from atop her head, framing her oval face with a
myriad of  waist-length braids.   Tiny beads and bells  are woven into her
silken tresses so that with even the slightest movement she is accompanied
by soft chimes.  Rich chocolate colored eyes lined with thick, dark lashes
and full deep red rosebud lips, ever pouting or preparing for a kiss, only
seem to carry on the  enigma of this woman.   She is slender,  with a slim
waist  and long,  shapely legs.   Her small breasts  are high and  firm, a
compliment to gently rounded hips.
Extra descriptions: attire, choker, eyes.

Extra description for attire..
The attire  that this  woman wears is  quite exquisite.   A gown of slightly
opaque silk covers her slender frame from neck to toe,  though it's style is
daring giving well placed hints at what lay beneath while revealing nothing.
A soft pearly grey slashed with cream,  it clings to her body until reaching
her mid-thigh at which point it loosens to float down her long shapely legs.
A delicate,  intricate embriodery of a shimmering silver can be seen looping
and swirling about the hem,  cuffs and high collar of the gown.   Three tiny
rows of miniature pearls  that climb her slim back  hold her gown  in place.
A pair of slippers,  dyed to match,  peek forth from the  airy skirts of her
gown.  About her slim neck is an ornate choker of finely woven gold.

Extra description for choker..
About her slim neck is an ornate choker of finely woven gold.   The pattern
of the choker is intricate and consists of waves, artful swirls and circles
all  inter-linked  to form one  large pattern  that is pleasing to the eye.
Supported by this work of art is a  night-black sheath.   Housed within the
sheath is a thin dagger just as ornate as the choker it bedecks.  There are
several small holes upon the golden hilt,  as if for the placement of beads
or jewels,  however they sit empty in wait.   There are no other adornments
to the knife other than it's simple etchings.

Extra description for eyes..
At first glance this  woman's eyes seem to shine with an unforgotten inno-
cence,  this effect is only enhanced by her  almost doll-face appearance -
her eyes are still as wide as a child's. But upon closer examination those
dark chocolate  orbs glitter and glisten with an inner-light.   A light of
knowledge and  wisdom that  far surpass  the youth  that that  her  smooth
complexion hints at.

If you were to help me create a 'help handbook' and a 'help timeline'
I would IMMENSELY appreciate that. It would slow me down a great deal.

Also, the mislinksing in Cairhien.. you don't have to do them yourself,
just show me what you mean. I walked around and looked for mislinks
in zone 132, but I couldn't find any. Everything seems connected
properly.

I had several ideas for Cairhien.

While you are looking around for mislinked rooms, perhaps
you could make objects in front of each Inn, like signposts
or those hanging things with the pictures on them?

Also, the room names of streets should be colored, so people
can navigate using 'brief'. That will actually be really easy
using RSET.

The Palace needs recoloring.. `%fuschia`7 and `^blue`7 aren't
doing it for me. At all. :P

Also, look at 'help builder commands'. We have several new
options to choose from. :D

If you want to work on any of these things, let me know.

I want to fix Cairhien, but it's low on my list now.

Btw.. The Tower proper is officially done. :D The only
thing left are the basements.

Have you checked with Etheniel on the noble connection? She will need
to approve your father being the High Lord, as well as the items. 
I am also just a little concerned about the idea of a 'cruel' orphanage
in TV where even babies are beaten....the White Tower is -very- much
in control of everything that happens on the island. I have a hard time
believing several hundred AS would ignore something like that.
Particularly the Yellows, who tend to take "care of others" to an
extreme. Could you put the orphanage maybe in a southern borderland
town in Sheinar? The Tower is well-respected throughout the
Borderlands, so the motivations for the character would not need to
be altered at all. Many AS travel through the Borderlands on a regular
vbasis, and quite a few live in those lands as well. The AS your mom was
trying to reach could easily live in Sheinar as opposed to TV.
Let me know your thoughts, and sorry this took so long.
Ah, just realized I forgot to copy Balinor and Etheniel on this. I
will forward them a copy. Reply to them as well, if you need to.

and death over every person in the Empire.
 
`7Recently, the Seanchan have returned to the mainland and invaded at

Ok, Ile.
 
 I got the Sitter's Offices desced last night. I am proud to say
 that we have very little left in the way of actual descing left
 to do.
 
This is what is left to be done:
 
-The classroom wing needs to be desced. 
-The skyways leading between the various towers and the White
 Tower need to be described. You can find them by typing vnum
 room skyway.
-The Yellow Ajah Offices were not desced. Leave those for Syrah.
 
To be honest, I think that's all that is left. We're almost done.
 
 I have one small project for you.. this seems like it would be
 something right up your alley. I was considering putting in a
 bunch of books into the shelves in the Great Library. We have
 a bunch in zone 3.. why not use those? But I know we could use
 extras, and you already have several made.  
 
 If you decided to make any more book objects, throw them in zone
 three. I will use them all from there. Remember, when you set
 any of them, that you need to set the number on the MUD to 0, so
 I can set as many books as I want to.
 
 After this, I am going to work on Cairhien. When I was discussing
 fixing up Caemlyn on wiznet, Syrah said something along the
 lines of, 'I thought I assigned you to Cairhien. :P' I wanna
 keep her happy. :P
 
 Of course, I want you to pick a job you are happy with. I was
 hoping that you could focus on the shops in Caemlyn, so we can
 actually get EQ into the game. 
 
Let me know your thoughts about all of this.

Room 13386 needs a south link to 13285
13374 needs a link east to 13225
I found a room name error (I think) 13235 should be named South East Square oor something similar. 
It is referred by that in a rdesc to the north and is currently named for a street that is well north
of that room.

There are a few hyphenation errors.  One room should have surroundings instead of surrounds, etc.

The Owl and Heron has a good many grammatical things.  The most glaring is heavy use of contractions.
There's for there is is prevalent.  I can go through and touch up all of those as well.  Or provide a

I did not go through the palace itself, but I can if it is desird.

He has tattoo of a `#Rising Sun`7 on his left arm, the artwork is very bright and detailed. He always seems to bear a grin or smile of some type and a glimmer of mischief in his eyes. He has short black hair, light emerald eyes, and tan skin.

The mans clothing is covered by a `7grey`7 hooded cloak. As he moves you may catch a glance of a very well made deep mocha leather tunic and dark `4blue`7 breeches
with `#gold`7 stitching. Under his tunic he wears a thin white shirt of fine silk. The breeches are tucked into a pair a very well made polished boots of a deep mocha color. Around his waist he wears a leather belt of fine quality the same mocha color as the 
boots. A strong gust of wind may reveal two ivory hilts, the carving work on the hilts alone looks to be done very skillfully. Each blade is made with very high grade metal for Jasils purpose. One blade is slightly curved the other straight, each are very well polished and shine as so. His clothing is kept very neat and clean it is all made of high quality material, it looks very expensive.

Background

Jasil was born in the outskirts of Cairhien in the Foregate, his family was not wealthy.
His father worked as a small time merchant selling many different goods he made to make a living for his family. As a young boy Jasil got to visit the city and as far south as Maerone while helping his father out with his trade. A few years later during the first burning of the Foregate all of his family was killed, Jasil managed to get out of the house in time to seek refuge. He followed like many of the survivors into the city once he realized he had lost his family.

Jasil met a young woman from the Foregate once inside Cairhien walls. They shared the story of loses and kept each other company for some time to. The woman took Jasil in you could say even if the first few months of life was rough in the streets. Not much time passed before she somehow managed to pull in a nice bit of coin to afford a decent if not nice inn for them to stay. She taught Jasil how to use daggers and knifes as well as how to move without being seen or heard for protection.

After a couple years passed Jasil set out on his own to explore the world to see what else may be beyond what he knew. He traveled as far west as Arad Doman, Tarabon as far south as Tear, Illian, and north as far as Maradon stopping to see many things in his journeys. As you can expect that took time, it was well worth it once he was satisfied he returned to Cairhien to seek work with what he learned from the woman and his travels. For many months he worked just to get coin in order to have a place to stay and food to eat, honest or not he did what he had to. Many Houses unknown to Jasil took notice to this, most thinking how well the skills could benefit them.

Jasil has worked with many plotting Lords and Ladies of Cairhien he built wealth fast.
With only being caught once he was given a light sentence for appearance sake as strings were pulled. He served a few short months as a Sun Guard helping with the night watch over the streets. Many thieves would learn that it might be better to fight him rather than flee. After his duty with the Guard was up he was once again back to doing tasks for Houses filling his pockets even more.

Some may call him an assassin, thief, or troublemaker as dark as

of prank on me or what, but when I got up this morning, my
connection to the game via Maty was lost, and just before it
had disconnected, there was a message that said:

Your character has been deleted.

Now clearly, my character is not deleted, so all is well.
But I also noticed that a new character has been created
with the name Inv.  Inv is short for inventory, which is
the command I use for my idle timer so I don't idle out.
How it managed to make its own character is beyond me.

Brai,

Sorry I was away, but I had some major RL issues going
on. I am back now, and will be on probably three times
a week or so at least. I'll have time on thursdays to 
sit down and deal with building, like I did before.

Duren told me that you finished a zone.. he wasn't certain
but thought you did. I just wanted to check, because I
didn't see any mudmail pertaining to an entire zone, just
the cairhien mislinks. 

I will go through the mislinks and grade them (hopefully)
by tonight.

Also, next time I see you on I'd like to assign you a new
area. I have several things in the ubermap I'd like to see
implemented, but I need to sit down and talk with you and
make sure you're interested in doing them all. 

Thanks!

`7From`6:`7 Serghi
`7Subj`6:`7 Serghi and Lucrezia - a previous background,
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7

Serghi den Lushenos started life in Cairhein, son of the Lord Argil
and Lady Bradona Damodred. His father Argil and his mother, Lady Bradona
were killed in a freak accident when their coach was crushed as workmen
were repairing on of the Topless Towers of Cairhein. This accident coincided
with Laman Damodred's subseqent rise to power in the House of Damodred.
 Fearing for the life of the orphaned son, the Nanny to the young
Serghi took him out of Cairhein under the cover of night by barge to Caemlyn.
Once there, he was given to her cousin who had connections with the Illian
House of den Lushenos.Serghi was given to be raised in Illian, along with
the Lady Bradona's jewels to support the cost of raising him in the manner
of one who was inline to heir the most powerful of Cairheinien Houses.
Serghi's younger years were fraught with hard feelings and resentment
from those of the den Lushenos House. The eldest son, Assario made it quite
apparent that Serghi was unwanted and unwelcome in the tight-knit den Lushenos
House. Although not treated as a true noble of the house, he was given a nobles
education in letters, edicate and protocol. Yet,at the same time Assario and his
brothers would beat and berate the young Serghi setting him up to take punishment
for their foul deeds and cruel behavior of the servants and animals of the manor.
This made the Lord Anigair den Lushenos leary about entrusting any responsiblity or
position of authority on young Serghi. Hence Serghi began his younger years as a man,
bored and hated umoung those in Illian whom he was destined to spend his life with.
 Serghi kept to himself, biding his time with cheap thugs and brothel women.
His self loathing breed in him the means of darkness that hid under the surface. 
Serghi learned from these thugs the means of torture and abuse especialy to those
who found themselves smaller and weaker than he. He studies the arts of poisons,
and acts of torture, hoping someday he would find a use for them.
Serghi 'talents" were honed to a fine edge and he was given the task of 
employing whatever means needed to gain political advantage for the House. Whether
be it, posion, or the explotation of a rival nobles daughter, extortion against a
business or guild who's dealings with the House were less than satisfactory.
One evening a debt the High Lord Anigiar had aquired was not paid with to the 
satisfaction of the debtor. The rule of the House was passed to Assario, as the
 High Lord's head was crushed by Hooded men in the presence of the whole of the House. 
With the Assario's rise to power within the House of den Lushenos, Serghi 
had no choice but to leave Illian with a pouch of gold sovereigns and a few precious
gems, they would not last long with Serghi's taste. Enroute through Andor he met a woman,
Lucrezia Rosseau, a domani with enticing beauty and a lack of scruples to match Serghi's.
They travelled through Andor and to Cairhein, finding marks and swindling men who found
Lucrezia's beauty so overpowering they forgot to notice the dark alley she had just led
them into. The two have been more partners than lovers, and have found their association
mutualy benefical.
Serghi is a brute and a boorish advisary. He will always chose intimidation to
physical force. He likes to play one side against the other for as long as he can, and 
will always indulge his baser instincts when he feels so inclined.  He has a pention for 
torture (always with consent, and only IC) and will always pick prey that are smaller than
himself. He aligns himself with the Council of Nine in Illian and has a hatred of the
Monarchy, and the House den Balgar.  In Cairhein, while still being Damodred,
will avail himself to whoever is in power at the time.
** OOC Stuff and character issues **
Serghi is a male channler, but WILL NEVER use his power in public, it is his dark secret
and is used for df work and RP issues. His training will always be clandestine, and kept
to the utmost secrecy. He is a villain and it adds to his villany, but has almost been
impossible to DF as a non-channeling male unless you are just dying to be subservant to
EVERYONE else. I will not associate with ASHA (or whomever we are calling them in this
timeline) In previous RP only three people knew this fact. 
__________________________________________________________
New note: I odn't htink this char was built as a Channeller, but the above still applies
as to the fact that no one will know and it will not be used except to RP to a select
consenting few. I use it as a character device more than a RP device.
Thanks Serghi den Lushenos

for the ones he did, 2 for the ones he pointed out, for a
grand total of 25. 

Brailon, thank you for your hard work and please forgive me
for not getting to it sooner. 

Please feel free to do anymore mislinks and report to me as
soon as possible. I will keep giving you QPs for whichever
ones you find. 

Syrah, Cairhien is beginning to come together, but still
needs alot of work. It won't be nearly as big of a project
as the Tower was, but it will still take time. Right now, 
I am going to focus on severeal things in Caemlyn which
Duren wants me to work on first. 

Anyways, thanks bunches Brailon, and I will work on grading zone 537 now.

Brailon, when you log on Builderport you will find that you
have been giving access to a few new zones. 

I gave you access to redit in zones 638, and 608. 

You can work on the rivers there. Also, if you want to
go throguh in your spare time and name the rooms 'Dense
Forest' 'Forest' "Farmland' 'Road' I will give you 30 Qps per 100 room zone.
They don't have to have descriptions, just the room names
so it will be easier to build without looking at the ubermap
all the time. 

I also gave you redit access to 132 and 133, so if you find any
more mislinks, just mail me after you fix them and I will make
sure you are rewarded. 

Thanks!

go throguh in your spare time and name the rooms 'Dense
Forest' 'Forest' "Farmland' 'Road' I will give you 30 Qps per 100 room zone.
They don't have to have descriptions, just the room names
so it will be easier to build without looking at the ubermap
all the time. 

I also gave you redit access to 132 and 133, so if you find any
more mislinks, just mail me after you fix them and I will make
sure you are rewarded. 

Thanks!

Hey, Emilia!

You haven't met me yet, but I am the Asst. Head Builder. 

Duren told me he set you to work you setting weight
values for zone 35. I went through and checked them,
and I wanted to let you know I was going to reward you
33 Qps for that work. That equates to about 5k exp,
if you turn them in. 

If you want to finish the rest of the EQ, I will make
sure you are rewarded right away. 

I can't reward you unless you are online though, so
I will see you soon to give it to you! :D

`7Subj`6:`7 Rhadian's Background.
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
I'm responding to this mail in two capacities. In my first, as WM Imm
(Parol), I'm concerned by the claims that Rhadian taught himself the use
of arms. Knowing how to throw a punch, not stab yourself with a dagger,
and not trip over a spear is one thing. But actually teaching yourself
to be a highly effective combatant in any of the three methods is unlikely
and not in keeping with our WM policy. You'll have to cut it back to
familiarity with the methods of combat, but no great skill.

In my second capacity, as Asha'man GL, my main concern is the direct
connection to Emond's Field and the possibility that the character may
have (and given his age, almost certainly would have) known the major
book-characters. I would very much prefer Rhadian come from one of the
other Two Rivers towns. A minor point is that Gleemen very rarely came
through the Two Rivers (as demonstrated by the clamor over Thom in Book
1), but you could have learned your rudimentary knowledge of the flute
during your time watching/talking to Gleemen in Caemlyn.

Your description is a slightly more serious concern to me. On MiT we
don't include actions in descriptions, because it that would mean that
you are doing that action every time someone glances at you, and even if
you are tied up or otherwise immobilized. Chopping the last paragraph
from your description (the one with the actions regarding the dagger and
the book) should satisfy that concern.

I'd like to see another background submitted taking these changes into
account, and I'll try to get back to you a great deal sooner this time.

`7From`6:`7 Garin
`7Subj`6:`7 Background for new character.
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
I was told I needed to send you my background for approval,
so I'm sending it now.  It is as follows:
Garin was born in a small village, named Farin, in Altara.
His family was never rich, but they usually had everything
they needed, and he worked that farm for most of his life.
He remembered staring up at the old short sword hanging
from his father's wall every day, wondering why he had it
and immagining all the wonderful adventures he must have
went through.
Shortly after Garin's 16th birthday, he found out when a
man knocked on the door.  He told of a great battle at
Dumai's wells, and how since then a losing battle was
being fought against the invaders who they now knew as
the Seanchan.  They where organizing all of the local
malitia to fight.  His father protested, saying he wasn't
a soldier, and the little fighting he had done had been
against bandits, not trained soldiers.
But the man would not be turned away and his father left
the next day to join the battle against the seanchan,
leaving Garin as the only man on the farm, even though he
had wanted to join his father.  Within months of his
father leaving, a Seanchan army was seen in the distance.
It was obvious what that meant and as the Sul'Dam
searched the village for channelers, both his sister and
his mother where taken.  He stood by and watched, weeping,
for the last of his family was going away.  The soldiers
confiscated his animals and his crops, and he supposed he
was lucky that they didn't claim the land as well.  He
reallized that there was nothing for him anymore and
decided that he had no choice but to try to find a new
life.  He sold what he could, even selling the land to a
neighboring farmer who had somehow managed to come out
well after the Seanchan took the village, and left with
the little money he had, trying to figure out what to do.
After 2 years of traveling and stopping at every village
and farm along the way, trying to find work or at least a
place that the Seanchan hadn't conquered, he finally found
himself in Andor.  Apparently the village hadn't been
conquered by the seanchan, and neither did the rest of
Andor.
He also heard some wonderful news.  The Dragon Reborn was
fighting the Seanchan, they said, and he had made a call for
male channelers to come to the newly formed Black Tower.  He
heard that there where men channeling everywhere, but contrary
to what most would think, they where doing well and not going
mad.  The problem was, those who had made it clear that they
approved didn't know where the Black Tower was, and those who
didn't wheren't the type he was about to ask.
He found himself going from village to village, asking around
about the rumors.  He figured he could go to the Black Tower and
try to learn to channel.  If he couldn't do that, he might be
able to join the City Guard.  He heard that Caemlyn was very
short of City Guards and they would teach him what he needed to
know.
And so he headed to Caemlyn.  On the way, he was stopped by a
bandit who held a sword up and demanded his money.  He was
frightened, but he couldn't afford to give the bandit his money.
He hadn't eaten in days and what he had would have to feed him and
give him lodging in Caemlyn.  As the bandit approached, he found
himself worried, knowing that he would die, but not wanting to!
In a stroke of luck, it seemed, a strike of lightning came down
from the sky, linking onto the man's upraised hand!  The Bandit
died instantly, flung back by the power of the lightning!  The
bandit's sword sat on the ground, not very good in the first place,
and slightly warped from the lightning.  Even though it wasn't the
best weapon, he decided to keep it.  After all, he couldn't count on
luck every time he ran into trouble.  As he reached Caemlyn, he rented
a room for a week with the little money he had.  What little he had
left he used to eat with.  However, even as the food came he felt
himself getting dizzy and sick.  He forced himself to eat, but he found
this to be bad as no sooner had he finished then he wretched it up.
He was carried up to his room, and laid down in the bed, and the
innkeeper sent for the wisdom.  She was busy, but she showed up a few
hours later.  By the time she arrived however, his fever had broken
and he was better, though he complained of a terrible headache.  By
the morning, he was all better and back on track towards finding the
Black Tower

Garin was born in a small village, named Farin, in Altara.
His family was never rich, but they usually had everything
they needed, and he worked that farm for most of his life.
He remembered staring up at the old short sword hanging
from his father's wall every day, wondering why he had it
and immagining all the wonderful adventures he must have
went through.
Shortly after Garin's 16th birthday, he found out when a
man knocked on the door.  He told of a great battle at
Dumai's wells, and how since then a losing battle was
being fought against the invaders who they now knew as
the Seanchan.  They where organizing all of the local
malitia to fight.  His father protested, saying he wasn't
a soldier, and the little fighting he had done had been
against bandits, not trained soldiers.
But the man would not be turned away and his father left
the next day to join the battle against the seanchan,
leaving Garin as the only man on the farm, even though he
had wanted to join his father.  Within months of his
father leaving, a Seanchan army was seen in the distance.
It was obvious what that meant and as the Sul'Dam
searched the village for channelers, both his sister and
his mother where taken.  He stood by and watched, weeping,
for the last of his family was going away.  The soldiers
confiscated his animals and his crops, and he supposed he
was lucky that they didn't claim the land as well.  He
reallized that there was nothing for him anymore and
decided that he had no choice but to try to find a new
life.  He sold what he could, even selling the land to a
neighboring farmer who had somehow managed to come out
well after the Seanchan took the village, and left with
the little money he had, trying to figure out what to do.
After 2 years of traveling and stopping at every village
and farm along the way, trying to find work or at least a
place that the Seanchan hadn't conquered, he finally found
himself in Andor.  Apparently the village hadn't been
conquered by the seanchan, and neither did the rest of
Andor.
He also heard some wonderful news.  The Dragon Reborn was
fighting the Seanchan, they said, and he had made a call for
male channelers to come to the newly formed Black Tower.  He
heard that there where men channeling everywhere, but contrary
to what most would think, they where doing well and not going
mad.  The problem was, those who had made it clear that they
approved didn't know where the Black Tower was, and those who
didn't wheren't the type he was about to ask.
He found himself going from village to village, asking around
about the rumors.  He figured he could go to the Black Tower and
try to learn to channel.  If he couldn't do that, he might be
able to join the City Guard.  He heard that Caemlyn was very
short of City Guards and they would teach him what he needed to
know.
And so he headed to Caemlyn.  On the way, he was stopped by a
bandit who held a sword up and demanded his money.  He was
frightened, but he couldn't afford to give the bandit his money.
He hadn't eaten in days and what he had would have to feed him and
give him lodging in Caemlyn.  As the bandit approached, he found
himself worried, knowing that he would die, but not wanting to!
In a stroke of luck, it seemed, a strike of lightning came down
from the sky, linking onto the man's upraised hand!  The Bandit
died instantly, flung back by the power of the lightning!  The
bandit's sword sat on the ground, not very good in the first place,
and slightly warped from the lightning.  Even though it wasn't the
best weapon, he decided to keep it.  After all, he couldn't count on
luck every time he ran into trouble.  As he reached Caemlyn, he rented
a room for a week with the little money he had.  What little he had
left he used to eat with.  However, even as the food came he felt
himself getting dizzy and sick.  He forced himself to eat, but he found
this to be bad as no sooner had he finished then he wretched it up.
He was carried up to his room, and laid down in the bed, and the
innkeeper sent for the wisdom.  She was busy, but she showed up a few
hours later.  By the time she arrived however, his fever had broken
and he was better, though he complained of a terrible headache.  By
the morning, he was all better and back on track towards finding the
Black Tower.

pemote The two women, much different in appearance, are similar in manner and expression while Cam relates what he will.  In some ways it is more than they expected by a fair margin.  For Jenalla, it is a fair bit less than hoped and raises more questions.  Of course, for her, there is more of a relationship as Delaen, accepting of the 'Mayener's' presence and contributions, rarely dealt with him directly and was doing so on the advice and request of her husband.  The seamstress is not much comforted at Cam mentioning infinite resources as that narrows who he is working with quite a bit- assuming he is being truthful though the thought Cam might not be is slow in forming.  In general, despite misgivings, the merchant decides he is working with the Senachan in some form.  It is the safest belief to hold to in the event Cam is not and things go badly for him, and then those he was known to deal with are questioned.  Delaen is speaking while the seamstress is reaching this conclusion, "A noble cause and a pleasure to know your company will be found with some regularity."  Her smile makes it a sincere statement.

Time and distance might, but sometimes only if things are thought on and accomodation made.  Other times the past can lie in wait without fading to spring forth inconveniently.  Jenalla makes a show of thinking, settling back somewhat in her chair and the other woman makes no effort to interrupt the moment.  Finally the seamstress smiles and nods, "I can clear out my schedule for this evening."  Then she allows, "Perhaps another chair or two might not be amiss."  She is not thinking of Crysael joining them though the young woman's presence in the tavern could well prove interesting.  Delaen adds, "Karna will be part of the performance."  As in the first experience Cam had with the Grotto, and maybe with the same sense of almost desparate anticipation, the daughter may follow the mother's lead and not have contact until after the performance ends.  Delaen adds, "One more chair then, unless you mind."  Jenalla has already allowed she does not.

pemote Whether Jenalla is smiling or no, Telen would take her words to heart --which would a failing if he misjudged her-- unless an obvious jest.  "You are always welcome, mistress.  Thank you for the pleasant morning."  Outside her shop still, he accepts his coat and drapes it over the saddle, shifting the horse's lead to loop over his arm and letting his pack's strap fall off his shoulder, from where he turns his hand to hold it.  He takes the bottles and sample canister of chromium from the pack and hands them to the seamstress.  "You have the merchant's name and address if you should like more of the same quality.  The dyes are common to his region.  I am no expert, but he seemed knowledgeable if you have questions about them."

Telen grins at the walk and speech, sifting it through a mental sieve, which unlike many of the sieves spoken of and referring to processes of the mind, is often quite effective.  He chuckles dryly.  "He sounds like a sailor, and maybe one accustomed to dealing with merchants' or nobles' sons.  Or he would if he kept his questions to his self.  Since he did not, he is either quite a curious chap or interested in the wealth of this one."  Telen would not assume anything, and he is certain Brailon will keep the man in mind in the instance they encounter him later, better dressed and clean shaven or somesuch.  "Do you need aught of me? I will ride ahead to my various destinations, to arrive back at the seamstress Oureen's shop at sunset and from there walk to the Grotto."  Or trot.  It depends on whether Jenalla will ride or no.

Telen gives his assent clearly, though each time the woman looks for his answer as well as listens for it.  "No, that is all, and you have my thanks."  If there is irony in his eyes, it does not reach his words:  she has his coin, too.  "Forgive the inelegance of this --" he tells her, and shifts the pack so that the open mouth is at the counter.  He explains, "I have no coin pouch with me."  And he sweeps the silver into the mouth of the pack.  There is little sound as the coins fall onto cloth-wrapped bread and then slide further down into the canvas bottom of the pack, faint clinking as they touch one upon the other.  The flap of his pack is buckled and he sets the strap over his shoulder.  "Light's blessing," he tells the woman, nodding to the man behind the counter as he turns to leave.  The guards appear to be practicing statuary so he does not let on that he sees them as he opens the main entrance and walks out.

Telen thanks Jenalla and at first opportunity, asks a server if she will take coin against whatever Jenalla orders, and he points her out if the server does not know the seamstress.  From there, if he has not seen Gust or Karna, which is possible considering the work to be done and Karna's sometime involvement in the performance, he approaches sailors who have been friendlier to him to greet them and ask how was the last journey and if there have been changes, and when he has the chance, how the bilge rats are faring.  He does not join them to sit, saying he has a table on another platform with a lady friend.

Telen replies that he is well and chuckles at the last comment.  "Four? Does the ship have a resident cat as yet?" Perhaps Jeald has realized a cat or ferret or some other small animal would return more intelligent and thus more rewarding affection.  Perhaps not.  He has his small pack with him, having forgotten for the third time since leaving the seamstress' shop and arriving at the Grotto to transfer coin from the pack to his pockets.  Not all of it, but enough to cover small costs that crop up here and there.  "Is Bilford here? I thought I saw Hanen earlier, but I cannot see him now."  He does not ask about Founder yet, though he hopes the man's whereabouts will be made known eventually.

The man has given over trying to decipher all of Cam's thoughts and actions.  Judging the borderlander a good-hearted and honest man with good intentions through careful observation is enough until something suggests a mistake or a change in Cam's behavior.  A small smile forms, eyes carrying subdued humor, "I would not stay with me long either with the seamstress at your table as well as your friend.  If it were any other port, or almost any other night even in this one, I believe you would have had more of a challenge leaving him.  Business is going well.  We have recovered from the cost of repairs to the ship and some more besides.  Trade strengthens as the disruption and uncertainty caused by the invaders passes.  But with that is a loss of income for goods, so we carry more but get somewhat less for the weight hauled."  The Captain's attention had shifted from Cam to look over the common room, pausing at what could be the Baron's table where Crysael is still seated.  Then it returns to Cam, "But I do not think that part interests you so much, not the detail of it."  More subtle humor colors the words as Cam may well be curious to no end about the convoluted realities of making a profit on the seas in uncertain times, "We are doing well and thank you for the curiosity.  How are your fortunes?"

Jenalla is finding some entertainment talking to the man but his interest is a hair too forward as well as obviously knowing how he has been gifted by the fortune of birth and having some confidence in it opening opportunities.  None of that is unexpected nor uncommon so the seamstress is far from offended, but such things do not help with attraction, or at least not hers.  All the same he is more than a passable dancer so time passes pleasantly.  Crysael, smile remaining in place, replies, "Very good.  It is starting to feel a bit warm in the tavern and a breeze would be most welcome."  Outside it will not take too much time for her to become overly cool but even the variety of change can be appreciated.  The current dance is perhaps halfway through when Crysael asks, "What have you been doing?  Have you been traveling much?  If so, where have you gone?"

He wants to ask on the necklace he gave her, or tell her to wear it as often as possible, but it may be it is gone already, and it is not that important --not to him.  To him, it is a bit of metal he might attune to his self with Spirit and Earth, though her care of it would be flattering.  Asking if there is somewhat else she carries often would be telling, and so he does not.  Channeling would perhaps alarm Brailon, though the reason is easily discerned.  "Light's blessing, Crysael."  Interest encroaches upon the Void and reason wins without contest.  A display of affection now would be inappropriate while Jenalla is perhaps preparing to leave for home and the baron is about to gather his family for the same.

Gust is staring towards the door and standing a bit stiffly while Karna is speaking quietly by his ear, trying to keep him from being concerned.  It is not this night the young man is concerned about, not overly, and not even the time he is in Falme, but the months he is gone.  Gust is fairly sure he could run the man through at need, physically and mentally, and perhaps Karna could as well.  Relaxing slightly the young sailor lets out a breath and smiles at Karna.  Jenalla has spent the last minute wishing the man she has shared much of the night with a good remainder of the night in what is meant to see him on his way.  Eventually it is accepted in the spirit meant, that being grateful for the dance and conversation but without the possibility of more, before she has to resort to blunt speech.  He bows low over her hand and turns away to go and recover an overcoat.  On the way towards the entrance the man stops to see what Jenalla is doing, not with ill intent but curious.  The seamstress is gliding to where Cam is with a comfortable smile, nodding as she comes to a stop, "This has been a wonderful evening.  Thank you."  Apparently guileless she adds, "Is there to be more?"  An eyebrow raised, the handsome man looks over Cam appraisingly, then with a mental shrug begins the walk home.

Telen chuckles.  He tells her, still smiling, "The short answer to that, mistress, is yes! Certainly, they do."  Since Gust and Karna have obligingly drifted closer, he indicates them with a nod, feeling they will know they are included, and must be, for any invitation he implies or extends to the seamstress.  "The players are awake longer than I am each night, and they often gather beside a fire on a outside ledge."  He watches Karna for any clue he should withdraw the invitation he is making.  "I sometimes explore the Grotto's mysteries," which phrase is completely without innuendo, "though I do not expect to do so now that I am no longer employed here."

There is no sign of the younger man in the common room though he is close, and if the finder is used, can be guessed to be at the ledge already though the twisting nature of the passages could make it difficult to know the actual location of the ledge from the common room.  From the first time he was on the ledge, there is possibly one of the performers who invited him, one or more of the servers he danced with, or he simply asked.  Going without some kind of invitation or permission is unlike anything the pale man would do.  Even him asking is somewhat out of character so it is most likely there was invitation given.  Karna arches a delicate eyebrow that suggests the statement could be taken as a challenge of sorts.  Still, she has other matters to attend to rather than testing Cam's tolerance of her, bluntly expressed, opinions.  Her expression smoothes with a quiet laugh while Gust is grinning but manages to stay silent and the two move from the tavern's common room.  The seamstress is quiet a moment, considering then allowing, "I do not recall him clearly.  Perhaps when I see the man."  She looks around the common room to see if the young man is present, which is apparently not, then falls in besid Cam.

pemote Karna has not made an entirely unreasonable assumption.  "Oddly enough, I feel grateful for the work, so I may say I am indebted for it.  Productive work is preferable to make work, in this case running from one place to another in the cold and dark," while images fill the darkness and the cold wars with impetus, "though I will abide a few more minutes."  He does not intend to abrade Gust by the last words, the young man is likely aware of Karna's impatience more than anything else, even if he is not yet ceding to it.  "I will work the morning after I escort the seamstress back to her shop, and if it is a late morning, I will work until late afternoon as well.  If I am able, I will return here for the evening meal, late, and then I will take a room nearer to the center of the city."

Brailon stops, blinks a few times and focuses on Cam with a bland expression for a heartbeat before making a gentle grunt in response to the other man's look, "For whatever I slept, I think it was good.  It may have been a few minutes, here and there."  Not having to worry about boots the young man straightens the rest of his clothing, twisted out of normal positioning, then works to lace his shirt back up.  Squinting out into mists he murmurs, "Almost as if we were among the clouds up here, like this.  Making slow progress with his shirt but not choosing to care about the chill the pale Asha'man looks over the makeshift bedding and forms within, something like bemusement forming, "Light's blessings.  If you brought water, juice or milk, I will be in your debt forever."  He already is, for another reason, much more important.

Will be afk for about an hour.

Telen replies, "You are welcome.  There is salve for your fingers in the Grotto's hospice, or the stables.  Whichever is more convenient to ask on, they are both a moderate walk from here."  He turns to watch Brailon's coat, what he can see of it under a layer or two of blankets.  "Light's blessing."  If Brailon does not then hand him the bowl, Telen says nothing about it and leaves the ledge to see if the seamstress' door is open or unlocked.  He takes his small pack and coat from his room, looking over the furniture and bedding tidied much earlier in the morning.  All seems in good order.

Jenalla gives a small curtsey, "The tea if you please Master Corlaeg."  Taking the cup she joins him along the way to the common room and admits, "I did not expect such quality.  Then, I did not know there were rooms for guests."  Everyone has their own preferences, but for getting away without worry over external disturbance, sleeping in any of the Grotto's rooms would be ideal.  Especially if someone were the type to not worry over time so that the body slept to its own needs instead of those imposed by llight and dark, or responsibility.  The luxury must come at impressive cost though so even if she were able to clear her schedule to allow indulgence, she would not likely be able to do so here.  All of the thought passes in little more than the blink of an eye and is then set aside, "Thank you again.  I forget such a place is so close.  It is very nearly another land altogether."  In many ways it is even farther from the norm of her life than being in another land would be.

Jenalla is finished and places a napkin back on the table beside her plate, standing with thanks as Cam helps her with the chair.  "What happened to his hands?"  They did not seem to be injured in the least not many hours ago and the seamstress had not noticed the consequences of the playing the young man performed.  While listening she moves easily, displaying no soreness or aftereffects of the night before- though some are felt.  The most notable consequence is she will be tired all of the day in a way the woman is unaccustomed to so that her jaws may well be aching by the time the business day is complete from the effort to resist yawns. more appealing, Jon may have the honor of seeing to business as she naps at some time.  There is a small detour as she recovers her own, warm outer layers and then she is ready to accompany him to the stables.

There is no real way to go into it in the current setting, something that is good and bad.  After partings are given and Cam returns attention to Jenalla, there is no indication she wishes to wait.  It has been a marvelous escape but now she is beginning to feel the weight of responsibility gain power and her thoughts click along what is to be done this day.  There is also the incentive to work quickly in the event more entertainment may present itself over the next couple of days so that her schedule will allow for it.  Once exposed to the breeze and early morning cold, the seamstress may rethink remaining in the kitchen a bit longer, but not in any serious manner.

(afk a while) Telen keeps pace with Jenalla, noting the seamstress is in no way lagging her walk.  The same horse is saddled and bridled with a lead, which Telen accepts with sincere thanks --not that he has given thanks in any other manner-- and wishing the stablehand who is present the Light's blessing.  Since Jenalla has a workday ahead of her and comparatively little sleep, at a guess, Telen does not pause at the stables to converse with folk he knows or would like to know better.  It is a short time from stables to gate, and then he is walking outward of the road where the road is tended and the sides brambles and vines, and then switching to inward when the traffic begs a larger obstacle than Jenalla in her long dress.

Fortunately the weaponsmaster's daughter is not the one handing over the bridle or there would be some form of conversation, not that the conversation would necessarily be unfortunate biut the time taken might be.  In the interior of the stables she can be seen in snatches, saddling up another of the horses for whatever purpose.  Her ideal would be for exercising the animal.  The morning is chill but the wind is all but absent, as close as it manages to get this close to the coast and what there is grows less as the pair beginning the gentle descent towards the more typical level of the city of Falme.  Jenalla walks quickly at the beginning as a way to get blood flowing and gain more protection from the breezes, then slowing as the woman assumes Cam will match her pace.  Before getting closer to the city and beginning to meld with traffic, she looks up into a sky that is again all but clear of clouds, only high up, ephemeral striations whose undersides are painted orange from the rising sun.  She wears a small smile of simple enjoyment and appreciation of something her schedule very rarely allows.  This lasts until they dip down into mists not yet gone which brings a greater chill.  With much of the beauty of the morning now beyond the gray layer she turns to conversation, "You are back to your research for the day then, trying to fit in time to meet with Gust?"  Even with the mild dampness and greater chill within the fog the seamstress seems comfortable, walking normally with gaze ahead to see what may need to be avoided.

pemote Certainly, all need the Creator's protection, but Telen reserves the statement customarily for a certain genre of folk, not often resembling Jenalla in word or deed or social stature.  He gives the seamstress a bow with a flourish as she retreats into her home and workplace, and then he burdens his mount to ride out of the city to the south, heading toward the cheerier of the healers he will call on today, and perhaps only in the earlier hours of it.  The horse is light on its feet and a good height to bear him without looking like a pony under a scarecrow.  He misses the formidable and easy strength of the almost black, and the banked fire of the razor, but this is an able, pleasant animal.  It's shoes are the same as yesterday, which he expected though fortune could have easily had today or tomorrow be the day the hooves are trimmed and new shoes fitted.  He wonders, idly, how much a finder would have to be altered, physically, to become useless as a finder, of if it always was, down to the smallest parts of it, as in, for example, the iron of the shoe remaining a finder if it were melted down and reformed into a window weight.

Okay, I've been giving things some thought, and here's what
I've been coming up with.  Starting the construction on
Elaida's palace has given me an idea for what to do with all
those extra soldiers.  So here is what Maty is going to do:

The lower floor of the palace will be used as a research center,
as planned.  Research designed to encourage cooperation between
Asha'man and Aes Sedai, and mostly under the supervision of
the Red Ajah, who will be required to make regular reports to
Maty of any progress made.  The upper floors of the palace
will be a Tower.  In the books, it says that Elaida was in
fact planning to make her palace taller than the White Tower
itself.  I'm not going to make a bunch of rooms for that. I'm
just going to make it taller, as in, a tower.  A tower in
which to house hundreds of soldiers.  Maty is going to call it
'The Tower of the Night Watch', and the entire palace will be
dedicated to fighting Tarmon Gai'don.  Maty will attempt to
see if she can rally these soldiers to prepare to fight in
the Last Battle, by giving them a place to stay, and giving
them a name: The Night Watch.  The White Tower will also
support their training, and the Tower of the Night Watch will
have its own kitchens, and its own staff, which can be taken
from any other extra people who have come to Tar Valon with
the rebel army.  The new palace will also have training grounds,
rooms dedicated to specific research, as well as gardens and
such.  It will be within the Tower grounds, and will connect
to the White Tower gardens via an elaborate hedge maze, as well
as regular walkways.

To elaborate more on the soldiers, the Tower portion of the
palace will be their home.  Each floor of the Tower will house
bunks for the soldiers, like a huge barracks on three different
levels.  There will be a dining hall on the second floor, where
both soldiers, and researchers can join together to eat.  The
soldiers' duty will be to protect the research palace from any
unwanted visitors, such as darkfriends or worse.  The purpose
of the Tower itself is to act as a watchtower for any major
threats within or without the city.  The soldiers will keep
that watch, and perhaps be assigned missions to investigate
this or that disturbance that might be shadow-related, with
a number of Aes Sedai as well.  That way, not all of the soldiers
are actually in the Tower at the same time, so those who are not
on some mission, can rotate into the bunks of those soldiers who
are.  I'm not sure exactly how many the Tower will be able to
hold all at one time, but I think it will hold a good many if
the description I am remembering is accurate.  It's supposed to
be a huge building, but within the Tower Grounds.  I think it
will work.  What do you think? :)

Asha'man and Aes Sedai, and mostly under the supervision of
the Red Ajah, who will be required to make regular reports to
Maty of any progress made.  The upper floors of the palace
will be a Tower.  In the books, it says that Elaida was in
fact planning to make her palace taller than the White Tower
itself.  I'm not going to make a bunch of rooms for that. I'm
just going to make it taller, as in, a tower.  A tower in
which to house hundreds of soldiers.  Maty is going to call it
'The Tower of the Night Watch', and the entire palace will be
dedicated to fighting Tarmon Gai'don.  Maty will attempt to
see if she can rally these soldiers to prepare to fight in
the Last Battle, by giving them a place to stay, and giving
them a name: The Night Watch.  The White Tower will also
support their training, and the Tower of the Night Watch will
have its own kitchens, and its own staff, which can be taken
from any other extra people who have come to Tar Valon with
the rebel army.  The new palace will also have training grounds,
rooms dedicated to specific research, as well as gardens and
such.  It will be within the Tower grounds, and will connect
to the White Tower gardens via an elaborate hedge maze, as well
as regular walkways.

To elaborate more on the soldiers, the Tower portion of the
palace will be their home.  Each floor of the Tower will house
bunks for the soldiers, like a huge barracks on three different
levels.  There will be a dining hall on the second floor, where
both soldiers, and researchers can join together to eat.  The
soldiers' duty will be to protect the research palace from any
unwanted visitors, such as darkfriends or worse.  The purpose
of the Tower itself is to act as a watchtower for any major
threats within or without the city.  The soldiers will keep
that watch, and perhaps be assigned missions to investigate
this or that disturbance that might be shadow-related, with
a number of Aes Sedai as well.  That way, not all of the soldiers
are actually in the Tower at the same time, so those who are not
on some mission, can rotate into the bunks of those soldiers who
are.  I'm not sure exactly how many the Tower will be able to
hold all at one time, but I think it will hold a good many if
the description I am remembering is accurate.  It's supposed to
be a huge building, but within the Tower Grounds.  I think it
will work.  What do you think? :)

`7CC`6: `7Maelyn Balinor I spoke briefly with Maelyn, and we discussed in brief
joining.  As such, I have prepared a BG with the hopes that it meets your
approval for guilding me as a guest so that we may conduct RP that will
eventually see me into the position of a Warder Trainee.  So here goes, please
note that I'm perfectly willing to amend whatever it is you feel needs
changing.  

Born in the Town of Sidon, Sevristh Kigali grew up the only child of relatively
wealthy merchants of Alum.  Their estate, though not lavish or grandiose as
many in Jehannah might be, was quite well known amongst the community, as were
Sevristh parents.  Most of his formative years his father was absent seeing
about the family business, and his mother was preoccupied with many functions
within the town.  After a number of small incidents that revolved around his
naturally mischievous nature his parents had decided to send him to Jehannah
where he could stay with aunt and uncle and their sons.  

In Jehannah, his aunt tutored him and his cousins: while his uncle, a bit of a
renowned swordsman in those parts, instructed in the basics of swordsmanship
and martial knowledge.  At the time, having no particularly great interest in
the craft Sevristh often found himself observing the city, and the people, or
spending time out on the River Boern.  

Shortly after rumour passed of a great battle in the sky Sevristh made a trip
to Sidon to visit his family, only to find that everything had been burned to
the ground.  Shock paralyzed him at first, and the panic set in as he tore
through the ruins of his birth place.  He found bodies, but nothing he
recognized, and somewhere through the bleak horror of it he found an inner
peace.  He believed that his parents were alive, that perhaps something had
come up that required his parents attentions with the business elsewhere and
that they had escaped this awful scene.  

Setting out first to Jehannah to let his extended family know what had
transpired, he then traveled South.  Taking fare aboard a ship he sailed down
the River Eldar to Ebou Dar.  In Ebou Dar he sought connections to his parents
company, sought anyone with any information.  Months past, his money used up,
and still no word of encouragement.  The realities of his situation forced him
to find a job in simple labour.  Anything that could be done to earn a few
extra coppers that he could save to help in his search.  

Word of the Dragonsworn tearing apart Ghealdan eventually made its way to
Sevristh ears, and after so much work without results he decided to return to
Jehannah and be with his cousins and their parents.  Getting a spot on a ship
headed North up the Eldar he was once again sailing.  The ship docked in So
Harbor, the captain unwilling to travel further North once hearing more news
there, and so Sevristh was stuck for the moment.  Upon taking room and board at
the Golden Barge, a local inn, he was surprised to have ran into his cousins
who themselves had been traveling South.  Drink and dice were had, as his
cousins relayed the events of the Dragonsworn, of the King and his hunting
accident.  Sevristh eventually learns of the fate of his extended family at the
hands of the Dragonsworn, of his uncle falling in with them, and of his aunt
who simply vanished.  Soon after his cousins made for Ebou Dar, hoping they
might find Sevristh there.  

After a few days Sevristh and his two cousins chose to stay in So Harbor,
finding wages working for local grain merchants and simple and inexpensive
rooming.  That is until, one day a group of armed men on horses came to the
town.  One of the men bore a top knot, much in the Shienarian fashion, and
another seemed like a smooth talking Andoran.  These men spoke of soldiering,
of working under the finest general in all the lands.  Sevristh cousins were
eager to join, they wanted to strike back at the Dragonsworn, they wanted
adventure, and they wanted to move on from hauling grain.  Soon enough they
were recruited to follow Gareth Bryne and his soldiers under the control of the
rebel Aes Sedai.  

It was here, that Sevristh really learned the basics of soldiering, the
requirements of the physical labour, and the discipline involved.  And so, like
many other men, he found himself on the move with this great host, all the way
to Tar Valon.  It was here, amongst these men, that he heard the stories of the
world beyond his small life.  It was here, that he first glimpsed an Aes Sedai,
or so at least he believes, and though he was not close to her, he thought only
an Aes Sedai would ride such a fine horse in such clothing with so many
soldiers about her and the Lord Gareth Bryne in her company

Hey Syrah,

Azanon/Sevristh is interested in helping finish the ubermap.  I want to get him 
set up as a builder, but I wanted to ask for your approval first.

Also, Maty has been very actively participating and helping out with building, 
especially when it comes to figuring out what zones need work and working with 
other builders to coordinate efforts.  I'd like to bump up her trust level so 
that she has access to the commands she needs in order to assign builds to 
particular zones and such.  Would that be OK?

Thanks,

Hello,

I recall at one time that I was GL of both Daes and Council.
I don't remember when this changed, but it used to work
very well.  If I could be reinstated as Council GL as well,
that would be awesome.  Council and Daes have always been
somewhat interconnected, and I feel like half a GL without
the ability to handle Council as well.  :)

P. S. Even if you can't make me GL of Council as well, can I
get my alias changed from Etheniel to Tatrise on the Council
channel?  Thanks.

You're all set up in zone 11, which is vnums 1100 through 1199.
Anna also has access to this area, so just be aware that you are both sharing the same vnums.

You're all set up in zone 11, which is vnums 1100 through 1199.
Anna also has access to this area, so just be aware that you are both sharing the same vnums.

Heya,

Can I have permission to edit zones 160 thru 162?  These are the
zones for Caemlyn.  Runen has requested a room in Caemlyn so
she can make a quest there involving a courier.  I can do it
for her easily, just need the ability to edit the zones. :)
Might be good to have access to it anyway so I can eventually help
work with quests and stuff there.  =)

I made you trust 98 on BP, so you should be able to edit
any zone you want.  If you do get permission errors, just grant yourself
access to the zone using the 'olc' command:

olc grant <player> <zone> <type> <level>

For now, the 'level' is always 2, we haven't coded other levels yet.
You can also grant other builders zone access as needed.

Sorry, I was mostly afk.  You need to edit the zones in the rooms
you want your mobs to load, so that they will load automatically.
Just type zedit in the room you want the mob to automatically load
in, then choose the 'New Command' option.  After that, choose the
'load mob to room' option.  Enter the vnum of the mob when asked.
How many should exist in the game?  1.  How many should load in
the room?  1.  Save.  If there are already other commands, you
might have to answer a question of 'Is this command dependant on
previous commands?"  Just say no.  Hope this helps.  That's why
your mobs don't show.  If the zone is copied over or the mud crashes,
your mobs will not remain unless you edit the zone as explained
above.  Then they will automatically reload when the zone resets.
That's why I gave you access to edit the Caemlyn zones. :)

If you have any questions, just ask!

Greetings, I'm going to try and get into some building while I have the
time. That being said, I was looking at starting to flesh out the
ubermap a bit. Assigning names, room-types, etc. and then starting to
add descriptions. So far, have there been any standards set for room
naming conventions or descriptions, as well as room types? For instance,
when coloring room names, do you want simple colors or something more
flashy. I generally prefer one color per word and no more than one or
two colors per room name, but that's just me. I've seen both as I've
walked around, and just wanted to know if there was an established
standard.

Also, as far as room types go, do we want rivers to be swimable or
non-swimable? Or should there be a variation of both? Has there been
any insight in the ubermap as to which is which? Right now I could
build them all one way, and just change them individually as it's decided
which rooms should be which. However, are most going to be swim or no swim?

I know mobprogs are probably a higher priority right now, but fleshing
out the map seems like it will fit into my schedule a bit better. I hope
to come on and add descriptions a few rooms at a time as I'm able. I figure
if I can even knock out 3-5 rooms a night, in addition to adding room names
to zones around that map, that would at least be some help.

Thanks,

`7From`6:`7 Lydandria
`7Subj`6:`7 Sorry! and...
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
I'd like to appologize for not being around for a little while.  Going
through a Navy hell-like school.  Things are a -little- hectic at times.

About my background.  I was wondering if there was an active (semi-active)
sister of the green ajah that I might be able to use in my idea (which might
need some corrections or help).  Here's the jist of it, though

Lydandria was born in Fal Dara, to a fairly well-to-do family.  Her father
was a warrior, and her mother a seamstress.  Her childhood was spent getting
scolded because of her tendency to climb trees, play with sticks, throw rocks
and other "boy-like" games, at least until her mother forced her into the hands
of a nanny.

Mistress al'Mairan was strict, but kind, and taught Lydandria how to behave as a
proper woman.  Instead of climbing trees, she learned history.  Instead of playing
at combat with sticks, she was taught sewing.  And last and most tradgic (in her
eyes) her stone-throwing days were replaced with dancing and etiquette.

Not too long after the raid on Fal Dara keep, Lydandria's ability to channel was
discovered by a visiting Aes Sedai.  By now, Lydandria was extatic to do anything
that did not involve stitching, or learning about a new spoon (though she would
never admit it to Mistress al'Mairan, she had grown to love reading and learning
about history).  Her parents were proud to learn that their daughter might one
day learn to Channel and become an Aes Sedai

So, with much assistance (and a bit of good-natured grumbling from her nanny)
she began to pack what little she would need as a Novice in the White Tower.

Ok..hereiswhatIproposefortheAielGuild.
 
The main group of Aiel have returned to the Three-Fold Land. 
However, Wise Ones can travel now, and this should not impede

sealing all of the Aiel off and not being able to RP with 
the rest of the MUD. 
 
I would like to set up a camp outside of Andor that is not 
generally known about. Possibly a few hundred spears living 
somewhere between Caemlyn and Alindaer. This would be the 
spot that Wise Ones would gate back and forth from, giving 
them a base in which to return should the Dragon Reborn need 
them again in the Wetlands. 
 
Ill need to build a small Three-fold Land. Ill leave it 
unconnected for the time being, just a few RPable rooms.. 
a Wise Ones tent, a Sweat Tent, and one hold.. Just until 
I have the time to build a larger Waste.
 
The Shaido are in Ghaeldan. I would like for any Aiel to

are raping and pillaging Ghaeldan, picking fights with 
Whitecloaks, but I don't see the need for any PCs to create 
Shaido alts for the time being. However, I would like to 
use them as an RP tool and the reason that a small camp has 
been left behind in Andor should the need arise to return 
and combat them.
 
I just wanted to run all of this by you so you could ok it

are raping and pillaging Ghaeldan, picking fights with 
Whitecloaks, but I don't see the need for any PCs to create 
Shaido alts for the time being. However, I would like to 
use them as an RP tool and the reason that a small camp has 
been left behind in Andor should the need arise to return 
and combat them.
 
I just wanted to run all of this by you so you could ok it 
all. Hopefully Haile will return and Ill be able to RP with 
her in the coming days.

`7CC`6: `7Duren Andon Ayasha 

Hey everyone! Just letting you know that I finished a small three room zone
for the Children of the Light. It's a small Embassy on the Outer Streets in
Caemlyn. I made it purposefully small because Ayasha informed me that the
Children's reach would not extend very far at the moment. 

I set the guild recall for Whitecloaks to vnum 16178 (The Embassy Foyer).

Duren & Ayasha: Could one of you port this into the live mud? The following
zones need to be ported over - 160 and 161, and an object in 162.

Andon: Let me know if everything is ok in there once it goes in, if you
need any tweaks just let me know.

    `6Welcome to A Moment in Tyme!  After a long hiatus, and with the long-

    from scratch at the end of Winter's Heart`6.  From there, A Moment 
    in Tyme will be a mirror world, where we write our own story.  Character 
    backgrounds will need to be re-written to exclude much of what has gone 
    before in the game, though original character concepts and backgrounds 
    can be worked into the new timeline.  `!Weaponmastery and Channeling 
    Mastery are a thing of the past.`6  The Imms are currently in the process 
    of reviewing the policies of the game.  Player input is welcome and 
    encouraged.  We have new guild leaders for Band of the Red Hand, the 
    Black Tower, Wolfkin, Children of the Light and Council.  There are still 
    guild leader spots to be filled.
.
    `&Code and Building`6:  We need help with the code, and with building.
    We will have a new turn-based combat system, auto-quests for quest
    points, and a large Ubermap to explore, with all kinds of secrets
    to uncover.  Tyme is currently an evolving work in progress, and RP
    is going to be our major means of earning experience and levels until
    the combat code is in. Volunteers to help are appreciated!

I would like to clean up the proj show board a bit, to remove references
to previous timelines, and perhaps get it a little less spammy.  I am going to
leave all the stuff about the new code, and the ubermap and stuff alone.  But
things like proj show 17.  Weather update.  That was like... 2 timelines ago. :P I
think those should go, along with anything else we don't really need.


Some of these posts were put up by people more godly than myself, so I wanted to
know if there is a way they can be removed.  Thanks! :)

`7Subj`6:`7 Item Costs/Materials
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Heya,

I am still confused about how to set the costs and such for the equipment
and items.  You said it was based on the materials they are made from in econ.  But,
I cannot figure out how to set on each item what materials they are made of, or 
how to figure out what they should weight/cost.

I noticed that all of the objects in zone 35 have values (under option C in oedit),
but, I do not know what those values are supposed to be, or how to set them, even if
I knew what they were.  Are those the materials?  If so, how do I set those?

As it is, I've just been setting weights on things that make sense.  I saw pants that
weighed 20, and thin silk veils that weighed 40, a pair of earrings that weighed 40.  It makes
no sense to me whatsoever, and if we're going to get this econ thing right so that shops will
work, I need a better explanation of how to do this. :)

I set the weights/costs of all the objects in zone 35 to what makes sense to me, as a
person who might buy those things.  I just can't seem to figure out if it's doing
any good though.

When you have time, can we sit down and talk about this so it makes more sense?  I really
want to get this right and work on it, but I feel stymied by the feeling that I don't
know what I'm doing. :P

Thanks,

Aya

`7From`6:`7 Nedjma
`7Subj`6:`7 Growing Up
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Growing Up

While her mother's roof was in Shiagi Hold proper, Nedjma spent much of her childhood
accompanying her father, who guided caravan merchants through the Three-Fold Land.  She 
enjoyed life on the road, the constantly changing scenery andcompany, the long quiet walks 
home with her father, and the deadly, still beauty of her home.  He taught her much about
the resilient plants and creatures that live in the TFL.

Always At Home
Eyes on the Horizon

Getting Started

Nedjma's first trip to Rhuidean was a horrifying experience, as it is for so many apprentice
Wise Ones and Clan Chiefs, but she recovered and, in fact, redoubled her efforts at learning
the ways of the Wise Ones to help her people be strong enough to survive the coming era of
prophecy.  Her second was much worse.  Visions of an inhabited Rhuidean consumed in flame,
friends and a husband and children lost in the smoke, and the choking stench of death visit 
her dreams even all these decades later.

Building Strength for Tomorrow
Haunted by the Future

The Crisis

Nedjma has been married twice, both deceased, and given birth to seven children.  Neither of
her husbands  were in her vision from Rhuidean.  However, shortly after leaving the 
Three-Fold Land to follow the Car'a'Carn, she saw a man briefly in Cairhien, just a face in 
the crowd, who was - and he was not Aiel.  Only years of discipline allowed her to master
the impulse to lift her skirts and run without stopping until she recrossed the Spine.
Nevertheless, she has several times sought him out in Tel'aran'rhiod without success.

Hiding from another Husband
Life is What it Is

On Your Own

Nedjma has traveled to Caemlyn with a large contingent of Aiel to assist Elayne Trakand
cement her hold on the throne.  It seemed important to the Car'a'carn, and Nedjma quietly 
enjoys the idea of Rand having a roof-mistress to come back to.  She has made friendly
acquainance with the local herbalists to learn about local plants and animals.  While
initially excited by snow, the endless Winter has begun to weigh heavily on her, and
exacerbated her homesickness.

Makes Friends with Strangers
Tired of Water

Description (minus color codes)

Standing straight and tall, Nedjma is a beautiful woman.  Her thick crimson hair cascades
down her back in waves and curls to the tips of her shoulder blades, with a shock of white
just left of her part-line.  Her tan face is marked by laugh lines at the corners of her
twinkling green eyes and her full, coral lips.  Silver hoop earrings dangle from her
earlobes.

Nedjma is 5'10" tall and is dressed in the typical garb of an Aiel woman. Her algode blouse
is open just slightly at the collar to all the hollow of her throat to show.  A dark brown
skirt, cinched with a colorful sash, falls to her ankles and rustles softly as she walks.
Soft leather boots peak out from beneath th ehem.
Her writsts are adorned with various gold and silver bracelets that clink together pleasantly

Her writsts are adorned with various gold and silver bracelets that clink together pleasantly
when she moves, and a beautiful silver righ set with amethyst adorns her right ring finger.

Heya,

Duren fowarded me your mail, since it pertains to building.  If you would like
to help, I'll be happy to get you set up on the builder port so you can learn.  :)

Just let me know when you're available.  Will probably set you up with one of the
Ubermap zones to start off so you can learn the building basics. Then maybe we can
move onto mobprogs, which are a bit more complicated.

I'll be around if you need me.

You were so right about those bottom three zones.  They are ALL a mess.  I
am going to do them myself.  Some of the rooms were even linked to other zones!
Lots of spelling errors, typos, run-on sentences, bad grammar, and whoever did
them, clearly ignored the Ubermap.  Not only that, but the Ubermap is wrong in
640.  It totally needs to have farmlands around Caemlyn.  So I am going to add
those in.  I still haven't figured out an easy way to update the Ubermap.  I
tried to do it in paint, but the fillbucket thingy just doesn't work.  Too many
pixels.  Anyway, I just wanted to thank you for pointing it out!  :/

Hiya,

You did a great job with 569.  I especially like the Twisted Devastation.
That place would be great for quests!  570 is a zone that I have been
working on, and I'd like to finish it.  I don't like to leave things un-
finished.  But, you are more than welcome to take up 469, 509, 538, 539 or
or 607.  All of these zones, according to dotproject, have 0 percent progress
done on them.  

Thank you, by the wa, for all your hard work!

so, seems pretty straightforward to me, as far as the basics go.
I think I can easily do the proofreading of room descriptions
in the white tower we discussed.  it looks like what, four zones?
proofreading descs for typos is the easy  part. If you
need me to check to make sure exits to make sure everything
connects right, I can do that too...but I'm kinda visual so
it would make it go quicker if I have a map to look at. Is
there a map of the tower as built on the mud?  If not, I
can do without, but for my own sanity and to make sure I
do it right, I'll have to draw a map as I go. :P  Let's see...
oh, you also mentioned something about checking keys.  That
you'll need to tell me what to do as far as commands and what
to look for to match up doors and keys, but I'm sure I can
handle it.  Anyway, just let me know.
p.s. sorry that seems kind of incoherent and babbling on re-reading
it, but I'm too tired to re-write more coherently. :P

Hiya, 

Just letting you know that I'm getting the shops to work!  I also fixed a
problem with Master Marston where he was selling a glass of wine of wine, etc. 
I had to change the names of the objects, because liquid containers
automatically put the type of liquid in the object description.  But, I ported
him over, all fixed and stuff, and he is doing just fine, and selling his items
at 7 coins a piece.  :D

I left off on the object editing at zone 37.  I'll do what I can some more on
it tomorrow.  But, I think I am making progress and just wanted you to know.

Rissa and I would like to bring back the concept of the Guild Tower, so that
players can have easy access to their guild areas, and those guilds that don't
have guild areas will have a place to link one to eventually, and to recall to
in Caemlyn.  

I'd need to create a new zone for this.  I don't want to use the Player
Testings, since those are for the Ubermap it seems.  But, I am apparently not
godly enough to make a new zone.  So, was wondering if you could grant me that
power, or if you can make one for us?  

Thanks.  :)

Just in case you don't see it in your playback:

It doesn't look like the Aiel camp is currently linked to the Ubermap.  I think
we're waiting until the Ubermap is complete before putting it in.  If it
belongs near Jangai pass, then we need to finish zone 567 and link it in there
somewhere.  

If nothing else, Rissa and I are hoping to bring back the guild tower.  So, it
can always be linked there once we get that back in place.

`7From`6:`7 Heathe
`7Subj`6:`7 BG for Heathe Maerran
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Heathe was born in Arafel, summer and winter on the farm, spring and fall in the city of Fal Moran with various relatives.  At the age of two, fourteen summers to the southern folk, his parents, he and his brother and two sisters leave their farm to settle in Far Madding.  There is no longer a farm, only the city and beyond it the grassy plains and gently rolling countryside with its winding rivers.  The reasons for their relocation can only be guessed by the children, and for three years, they make the transition from borderland to southern civilization, and from youth to young adult.
Far Madding is nowhere he wants to be at seventeen, Heathe is excited by the thought of seeing the world, maybe as far away as Tar Valon, or even Arafel, though he ends up traveling north and west, misjudging his coin and stalling in Whitebridge, stuck there for months after several more attempts to gain employ eastward.  From helpful souls in Whitebridge he learns that there is always work in Baerlon and, tempted by the wages mentioned, he reverses direction and once more goes west.  At nineteen years of age, he stands behind a cart filled with iron ore, his canvas smock saturated with fine black powder:  iron dust intermingled with rock powder from the adjacent quarry.
It is hard work, but the pay is more than what he expected from the gossip in Whitebridge.  He assumed then that the wages were an exaggeration, but it was about right, and he is able save some for another attempt at migration east.  The world is changing in leaps and bounds to hear the news, though the news itself comes in as fast as it ever did --not very-- and just as accurately, also not very.  He tries to filter through it and act as though most of it has to be untrue, though Light blast him for a gullible fool, he does believe it.  Traveling east becomes more and less appealing.  He continues to save his coin, shares a room with a friend, then with several friends.  Restlessness makes him miserly one minute, to save enough to leave earlier, and careless the next, wasting coin because of intolerable boredom.  He passes up several opportunities to work his way east as a guard or servant.  He looks the part but isnt qualified with his minimal weapons training, and he hasnt been able to picture himself polishing boots, scraping pots and doing laundry.  It doesnt take him long to decide he isnt going to pretend to know skills he doesnt have.
His friends, the few he keeps, soak up his extra coin one evening that turns into early morning, and he wakes up in an upstairs room at an inn, aching in several places with no idea why and missing a few things.  His boots, the boots he needs to work in the mines, are gone.  He paid good coin for those.  His head is splitting open agony, and his mouth is dry, gritty and tastes bad.  The corner of one side of his mouth twinges, and there is an immediate coppery trickle to explore gingerly with rough fingers.
He discovers he is on the other side of town than his rented space, and it is a long walk back on streets that are basically channels of churned up mud, almost always crowded with men and beasts.  He loses his footing several times to avoid hooves nearly the size of his head stepping too close to his unprotected feet.  Oxen and draft horses both haul wagons piled with bars of steel and lesser metals, the beasts barely straining, thick muscles shaking under healthy hides as they plod steadily forward.
The rest of his belongings he sees before he enters the front door of his house.  They are scattered across the ground, half in the grassy plot next to the steps and half in the mud of a narrow side street, which is cobbled high but muddied many times over by tracks off of the main streets.
He feels too sick to be angry, and his cursing is half-hearted.  He opens the door to go into the house and begins to ask what--? when his friends fist meets his face, knocking him back to stumble down the stairs and wobble another step further from the house, only to slip in the mud and land solidly on his back.  Very painful.  Not going to do that again.  He rolls to his side and blinks back tears.  Light burn them, is his first thought, and then since he is not a completely unreasonable young man, he thinks, what did I do? He hauls himself back on his feet and stares down at the few things he can claim.  A month of work would pay for new, but he needs boots now, for work this afternoon.  Burn them.  Burn me.  He walks out into the mud again and procures coin he has placed in a moneylenders keeping.  He buys boots.  He goes to work, and he tries again to save, full of self pity and too weak for a full tenday to try and salvage friendships.
He gives the rumors and gossip a much closer consideration.  To fi

 Before you stands a woman just an inch or so above average height. Raven black tresses, as though richly dyed threads of midnight, tumble in lush disarray across her slender soulders.  Eyes blue as the sea setting gently within a face that carries both slender enchantment as well as the dulcet charm of a woman.  Reaching further down her graceful figure provides the watcher an ample view of a dynamic and youthful form while displaying hints of her manner.  She wears a gown of rich, bordeaux with a slightly scooping neckline, discreetly hinting at the prominent slopes of her sonsie figure.  Encircling her hips is a delicate linked-chain belt, adding accept over her long and flowing skirts which completely cover tips of her toes.  The sleeves of her gown are fitted, a diaphinous second sleeve falls over her arms from the shoulders acting almost like a split cape.

Encircling her hips is a delicate linked-chain belt, adding accept over her long and flowing skirts which completely cover tips of her toes.  The sleeves of her gown are fitted, a diaphinous second sleeve falls over her arms from the shoulders acting almost like a split cape.

 Rayna Cormrael Rayna is the youngest member of her family.  In Saldaea the
family business Ice Peppers.  Her family had a large farm, no plantation would
be a better word, dedicated to Ice Peppers.  They also grew grains to feed
their livestock and any remaining grains would be sold in the capital.  While
her family was not Nobility, they were quite well off as the Ice Pepper trade
is quite lucritive.  As her mother and father grew too old to handle the daily
tasks of ensuring the crops were cared for properly her eldest brother,
Michael, has taken over the position.  This is fine by her, she's not able to
grow a marigold.  Something about a brown thumb.  She talked with her family at
great length and after months of negotiation, and a little disinformation,
Rayna finally convinced them to let her travel.  She had to learn the basics of
the sword, she knew how to use knives but swords require a little more
dedication.  If she has to, she can use it.  She left with money and the
information of what the plantation produced, she did fib a bit to say that
perhaps she could get the nations to the south to perhaps purchase the
delicious peppers.  She made her way south, to Illian where she prayed she'd
not be too late for the swearing in of the Hunters of the Horn.

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Ayasha,
I just wanted to send a mudmail with some ideas for my background, and hopefully some ideas for the future for the wolfkin and myself (as Miniver).  
My first question, is a long time ago I got approved, to play ta'varen (or however you spell it, don't have my books with me right now) and more or less, connected to the horn (reborn hero type thing, again, i'm still working on my homework and trying to get back in the lingo).  The storyline was more or less a decision of which side to fight on, which could even lead to betraying the wolves.  A sword was involved, but I can't remember much about that.  if i can find some of my old rp logs, it can be useful heh.
Anyway, would like to still RP along the same lines, that there is a choice for Miniver to make.  I'm not sure if Ruth (lironah) has talked to you about her plans for Miniver and the WK (and tainted wolves) but that comes into play there. 
Now I feel like I'm rambling, and prolly should write down what I want to write when I'm thinking about it at work heh.  sorry.
Crap, forgot the rest. anyway, sorry for bothering.

Hello there, 

I got your mudmail regarding ta'veren.  Here are my thoughts:

1.  There are already three ta'veren in the world: Rand, Mat and Perrin.  They
are very closely linked to one another.  I'm not saying players can't be maybe
lesser ta'veren with a role to play, however, this is a very, very rare thing
and we are not handing this talent out lightly.  

2.  You also play Perrin.  I am reluctant to see you playing two ta'veren, when
we will be giving these out so lightly to begin with.  Additionally, ta'veren
tend to be tied to one another in the Pattern from what we've seen in the
books, and that might conflict with your alt.  :/

3.  Lastly, regarding being tied to the Horn: If you mean you might be one of
the Heroes of the Horn, reincarnated in this Age, I don't think that would work
with what we know of the books.  The Heroes are all in Tel'aran'rhiod, like
Birgitte, right now, waiting to be reborn.  Until the Horn is blown, they are
needed in tel'aran'rhiod.  

So, those points being made, I would like to work with you if you would like
your background to be special.  But your mudmail was kind of vague on what his
background used to be, exactly, and how he has a choice to make, and what it
has to do with betraying the wolves.  If you like, I can help you come up with
something that will be comparable to what you are asking, but given what we
know of the books now compared to when you were approved for those things, I am
not certain it would work.  

If you could, is it possible to send me Miniver's background?  Then I will have
a better understanding of what you're asking.  Meanwhile, I'll talk stuff over
with Rissa and see if we can come up with any ideas that might work to replace
these things for the new timeline, without changing Miniver's character
overall.  

Does that sound fair?  Let me know, and if you can, please send me your BG.

The Chambers of Jezz Sedai 
  The large northern window is draped delicately in a thin veil of
w`&hit`7e `&M`7u`&r`7a`&nd`7ia`&n`7 l`&a`7ce which is coupled with heavy, `8black`7 c`&r`8ush`&e`7d v`8e`7l`8vet`7
curtains.  The v`8e`7lv`8e`7t`8ee`7n curtains are drawn back and held in place by
a l`&a`7cey w`&hit`7e ribbon.  The view from the window is one to behold for it
shows the vast North Harbor but the Dragonmount just to the west of the
Tower as well.  Before the window, sitting on a dainty pedestal is a
small potted `3f`2e`@r`2n`7, it's `@l`2ea`@f`2y `3v`2i`3n`@e`2s`7 reaching ever onward towards the
floor.  Beside the window, as if company to the `3f`2e`@r`2n`7, stands an `3easle`7.
A `&l`!a`1c`3q`7u`3e`1r`!e`&d `3m`1a`!p`1l`3e`8-`3w`1oo`3d`7 desk sits squarely in the middle of the eastern
wall.  High `3shelves`7, at least eight high, line the walls on either side
of the desk.  A `3painting`7 hangs above the desk silently.  Positioned
against the western wall is a canopy bed of `&l`!a`1c`3q`7u`3e`1r`!e`&d `3m`1a`!p`1l`3e`7.  The bed
is hidden by a m`&i`7st of d`&ia`7ph`&i`7n`&ou`7s w`&hit`7e cloth.  The m`&i`7st is parted on
one side by a l`&a`7cey `8black`7 r`8i`7bbon giving a peek to the delicate pillows
and w`&hit`7e l`&a`7ce`8-`7overl`&a`7id comforter set.  On the southern wall, near the
door, stands an `3armoire`7.  Beside the armoire sits a vanity with a large
m`&i`7rr`&o`7r.  A `8s`7i`&lv`7e`8r`7 handled comb and brush set `8g`7l`&i`^s`&t`7e`8n`7 silently beside a
dainty `&j`7e`8w`7e`&l`7r`8y`7 box.  Hanging on either side of the vanity mirror are
two paintings, one of a `3couple`7 and the other of her `3Warder`7.

shelves 
  Lining each of the `3shelves`7, sixteen in total, are a myriad of `6books`7.
The subjects of the `6books`7 vary from `8politics`7 and `4laws`7 of different
nations, to `^Prophecies`7.  There are `6books`7 on `#Healing`7 and other uses of
the `5Power`7 as well as a few on `2war`7 and `1Artur Hawking`7.  Even a few `6books`7
for recreational reading.  Each subject is arranged into it's own section,
giving order to what could have been a very chaotic place.

armoire 
  Standing near to six feet in height is this `&l`!a`1c`3q`7u`3e`1r`!e`&d `3m`1a`!p`1l`3e`8-`3w`1oo`3d`7
`3armoire`7.  Holding within it's protective depths, should one explore
within, are dresses and gowns in all shades of `2g`@r`2e`7e`2n`7 and `4b`*l`^u`6e`7.  W`&hit`7e
l`&a`7cey scarves hang upon pegs just inside the door.  Soft boots and
slippers line the bottom, giving an array of complete ensembles for
any and all occasions.

warder 
  Relaxing easily in comfortable, forest-green upholstered chair, the
broad shouldered Kandori man in question has a languid presence of a
lounging wolf.  `3B`1r`3on`1z`3e`7 and `3e`2ar`3th`2e`3n`7 tinged eyes look out from behind an
angular, ruggedly handsome face.  His unfettered, straight `#d`3u`#ne`7 blonde
lengths fall past is shoulders with an intricate braid over his right
ear.  His chest is covered with a fine w`&hit`7e linen tunic which is
unlaced at the neck.  The tunic is paired with an overlapping `8black
vest`7.  A pair of `8dark`7, form-fitting breeches reach into a pair of `8hard
leather boots`7 which are turned down at the ankle.  Propped against the
arm of the chair are two scabbards, one shorter than the other.  In his
hand he holds an open `6book`7 palmed along the spine.  There is a `3pl`#a`3q`#ue`7
along the bottom of the frame, it reads: `&Valaur Brys Trensieni`7.

easle 
  Several rows of finished and half-finished paintings lean against the
wall.  Some are frightful images in `4dark tones`7 - `8shadowspawn`7 and other
`8n`4i`8ghtm`4a`8r`4i`8sh`7 scenes - while others are of the view right outside the
window or along the vast pathways of `&Tar Valon`7.  A few of the faces are
recognizable, most likely all of those featured in the paintings the
artist knows.  Jars of `1p`2a`3i`4n`5t`7 are neatly lined up near the stack against
the wall.  This stack of paintings seem to hold company with the `3easle`7
and it's current showpiece, the `3f`2e`@r`2n`7.

couple 
  This painting is of a well dressed Lugardian `3couple`7.  The man has
short `8d`3a`8rk hair`7, broad shoulders and `8d`4a`8rk eyes`7.  He is dressed in
`8dark colors`7 with l`&a`7ce at the cuff and neck.  The woman has `3a`1ub`3u`1r`3n`7 hair
and `2green eyes`7 with slender frame.  She is wearing a modest `2green dress`7
with l`&a`7ce at the neck and cuff.  They both appear to be in their mid-
twenties.  The background is faded and somewhat indistinguishable for
the painting itself has faded and turned `3y`7e`3ll`7o`3w`7 with age.... more than
twenty years from the condition of it.  A small `3g`#o`3ld`#e`3n`7 plaque at the

A `&l`!a`1c`3q`7u`3e`1r`!e`&d `3m`1a`!p`1l`3e`8-`3w`1oo`3d`7 desk sits squarely in the middle of the eastern
wall.  High `3shelves`7, at least eight high, line the walls on either side
of the desk.  A `3painting`7 hangs above the desk silently.  Positioned
against the western wall is a canopy bed of `&l`!a`1c`3q`7u`3e`1r`!e`&d `3m`1a`!p`1l`3e`7.  The bed
is hidden by a m`&i`7st of d`&ia`7ph`&i`7n`&ou`7s w`&hit`7e cloth.  The m`&i`7st is parted on
one side by a l`&a`7cey `8black`7 r`8i`7bbon giving a peek to the delicate pillows
and w`&hit`7e l`&a`7ce`8-`7overl`&a`7id comforter set.  On the southern wall, near the
door, stands an `3armoire`7.  Beside the armoire sits a vanity with a large
m`&i`7rr`&o`7r.  A `8s`7i`&lv`7e`8r`7 handled comb and brush set `8g`7l`&i`^s`&t`7e`8n`7 silently beside a
dainty `&j`7e`8w`7e`&l`7r`8y`7 box.  Hanging on either side of the vanity mirror are
two paintings, one of a `3couple`7 and the other of her `3Warder`7.

shelves 
  Lining each of the `3shelves`7, sixteen in total, are a myriad of `6books`7.
The subjects of the `6books`7 vary from `8politics`7 and `4laws`7 of different
nations, to `^Prophecies`7.  There are `6books`7 on `#Healing`7 and other uses of
the `5Power`7 as well as a few on `2war`7 and `1Artur Hawking`7.  Even a few `6books`7
for recreational reading.  Each subject is arranged into it's own section,
giving order to what could have been a very chaotic place.

armoire 
  Standing near to six feet in height is this `&l`!a`1c`3q`7u`3e`1r`!e`&d `3m`1a`!p`1l`3e`8-`3w`1oo`3d`7
`3armoire`7.  Holding within it's protective depths, should one explore
within, are dresses and gowns in all shades of `2g`@r`2e`7e`2n`7 and `4b`*l`^u`6e`7.  W`&hit`7e
l`&a`7cey scarves hang upon pegs just inside the door.  Soft boots and
slippers line the bottom, giving an array of complete ensembles for
any and all occasions.

warder 
  Relaxing easily in comfortable, forest-green upholstered chair, the
broad shouldered Kandori man in question has a languid presence of a
lounging wolf.  `3B`1r`3on`1z`3e`7 and `3e`2ar`3th`2e`3n`7 tinged eyes look out from behind an
angular, ruggedly handsome face.  His unfettered, straight `#d`3u`#ne`7 blonde
lengths fall past is shoulders with an intricate braid over his right
ear.  His chest is covered with a fine w`&hit`7e linen tunic which is
unlaced at the neck.  The tunic is paired with an overlapping `8black
vest`7.  A pair of `8dark`7, form-fitting breeches reach into a pair of `8hard
leather boots`7 which are turned down at the ankle.  Propped against the
arm of the chair are two scabbards, one shorter than the other.  In his
hand he holds an open `6book`7 palmed along the spine.  There is a `3pl`#a`3q`#ue`7
along the bottom of the frame, it reads: `&Valaur Brys Trensieni`7.

easle 
  Several rows of finished and half-finished paintings lean against the
wall.  Some are frightful images in `4dark tones`7 - `8shadowspawn`7 and other
`8n`4i`8ghtm`4a`8r`4i`8sh`7 scenes - while others are of the view right outside the
window or along the vast pathways of `&Tar Valon`7.  A few of the faces are
recognizable, most likely all of those featured in the paintings the
artist knows.  Jars of `1p`2a`3i`4n`5t`7 are neatly lined up near the stack against
the wall.  This stack of paintings seem to hold company with the `3easle`7
and it's current showpiece, the `3f`2e`@r`2n`7.

couple 
  This painting is of a well dressed Lugardian `3couple`7.  The man has
short `8d`3a`8rk hair`7, broad shoulders and `8d`4a`8rk eyes`7.  He is dressed in
`8dark colors`7 with l`&a`7ce at the cuff and neck.  The woman has `3a`1ub`3u`1r`3n`7 hair
and `2green eyes`7 with slender frame.  She is wearing a modest `2green dress`7
with l`&a`7ce at the neck and cuff.  They both appear to be in their mid-
twenties.  The background is faded and somewhat indistinguishable for
the painting itself has faded and turned `3y`7e`3ll`7o`3w`7 with age.... more than
twenty years from the condition of it.  A small `3g`#o`3ld`#e`3n`7 plaque at the

`7CC`6: `7Anazail Jaiden Duren Ayasha 

Couple things I'd like to put on the table to be solved over the next little while as we work to bring code back and get everything in line:

`!1) `1Code vs RP exp.`7

When code comes back in and exp can be awarded for killing mobs, how will that exp be awarded vs how RP exp will be awarded?

On our drive back from Austin, the three of us talked about several different options, including bringing back the separation of code and RP levels.  The main crux was that code levels could be balanced to effectively eliminate the arbitrary assignment of 100 OCS, giving us the ability to make flowstrengths a scale of 1-100 (rather than a 'high' flowstrength being around 40 like right now).  Whether or not exp is all one system for code and RP or if they're split between code and RP levels, the question remains of how to balance RP exp gain with code exp gain, both overall (i.e., does RP award 100exp per emote and code awards 10exp per mob) and as a composite (i.e., how much RP exp = how much code exp *per emote*).

Anazail could explain it better because he has a better grasp on the math and a better idea how to balance code and RP exps, but while I really don't personally like the concept of code levels, they made some very persuasive arguments for the reintroduction of that system.

`!2) `1Channeling combat.`7

I would like to see a system of channeling combat that is less like D&D spells and more like channeling.  Anazail and I have discussed several options - and I think Anazail and Duren have talked about it a little bit, too - and while I know physical combat and the code combat system (along with econ, etc.) are the priorities, eventually I would like to bring channeling combat up to snuff with the rest of it.

Included here is the necessity of balancing chan/non-chan combat, including the requirement that the ambush be respected by the code.

`!3) `1Multiguilds and Guildskills.`7

Last week, Zach and I had a discussion regarding the multiguild system we have right now.  He pointed out that code-wise, a multiguild system is somewhat unbalancing with regard to guildskills - should the two be incorporated.  Basically, having code guildskills available to characters in multiple guilds is unfair.  If guildskills are to be re-introduced (as specific coded GUILDskills), we need to figure out how to restrict them in a way that does not limit PC creativity (Gleeman Sedai advisor to a Queen in DD?  Sure, be in all those guilds!) but that does not reward cheesing the system (Warder-trained Aiel Wolfkin? Uh... Signal Veil Wofldream Goldeneyes?  No... thank you...)

The old guild system made it impossible to have multiple guildskills, and while I prefer allowing players to be in as many guilds at a time as they can justify, I certainly don't want people having half the guildskills in the game on one character just because they wrote a neat background.

`!4) `1Imm trust.`7

Zach brought up the point that we, as Imms, have a lot of trust to regain with the players.  Though none of our current (active) staff has really ever abused that trust as far as I know, there is a long history of staff distrust that we have to overcome, because a lot of our players have long memories.  It isn't necessarily fair that we will be held to a standard based on the actions of previous Imms, but we will be, and missteps will serve to reinforce bad feelings on behalf of the playerbase.

Overcoming this is simple, but not easy.  First and foremost, we need to say what we mean and mean what we say - basically make promises and keep them.  Secondly, we should be as transparent as possible without endangering plots or player characters.  Third, we should be clear about our boundaries: our immranks should mean what they say and we should each respect the domains of the others - Ayasha is HEAD Building and Story, and has the final say on zones and plotlines, Anazail is HEAD Shadow and has final say on Shadowy stuffs, I've got Guilds and would like final say on Human Resources - but we should all be sharing our (non-secret) stuff with each other because none of it is totally independent.

For example, and just because it's a recent one, Ayasha has complete control over who gets bookies (aside from Forsaken), but a head's up to the rest of us so we know that the bookie's taken and by whom lets us look like we're all on the same page - and lets us be prepared to include them.  Doing what we do within our own purviews shouldn't require 'permission' from the others, but we should include each other in our decisions.  So far, this has not been any kind of issue - but it is something to keep in mind, since hoarding domains caused previous Imm staffs a lot of problems with playe

`7CC`6: `7Anazail Jaiden Duren Ayasha 

Couple things I'd like to put on the table to be solved over the next little while as we work to bring code back and get everything in line:

`!1) `1Code vs RP exp.`7

When code comes back in and exp can be awarded for killing mobs, how will that exp be awarded vs how RP exp will be awarded?

On our drive back from Austin, the three of us talked about several different options, including bringing back the separation of code and RP levels.  The main crux was that code levels could be balanced to effectively eliminate the arbitrary assignment of 100 OCS, giving us the ability to make flowstrengths a scale of 1-100 (rather than a 'high' flowstrength being around 40 like right now).  Whether or not exp is all one system for code and RP or if they're split between code and RP levels, the question remains of how to balance RP exp gain with code exp gain, both overall (i.e., does RP award 100exp per emote and code awards 10exp per mob) and as a composite (i.e., how much RP exp = how much code exp *per emote*).

Anazail could explain it better because he has a better grasp on the math and a better idea how to balance code and RP exps, but while I really don't personally like the concept of code levels, they made some very persuasive arguments for the reintroduction of that system.

`!2) `1Channeling combat.`7

I would like to see a system of channeling combat that is less like D&D spells and more like channeling.  Anazail and I have discussed several options - and I think Anazail and Duren have talked about it a little bit, too - and while I know physical combat and the code combat system (along with econ, etc.) are the priorities, eventually I would like to bring channeling combat up to snuff with the rest of it.

Included here is the necessity of balancing chan/non-chan combat, including the requirement that the ambush be respected by the code.

`!3) `1Multiguilds and Guildskills.`7

Last week, Zach and I had a discussion regarding the multiguild system we have right now.  He pointed out that code-wise, a multiguild system is somewhat unbalancing with regard to guildskills - should the two be incorporated.  Basically, having code guildskills available to characters in multiple guilds is unfair.  If guildskills are to be re-introduced (as specific coded GUILDskills), we need to figure out how to restrict them in a way that does not limit PC creativity (Gleeman Sedai advisor to a Queen in DD?  Sure, be in all those guilds!) but that does not reward cheesing the system (Warder-trained Aiel Wolfkin? Uh... Signal Veil Wofldream Goldeneyes?  No... thank you...)

The old guild system made it impossible to have multiple guildskills, and while I prefer allowing players to be in as many guilds at a time as they can justify, I certainly don't want people having half the guildskills in the game on one character just because they wrote a neat background.

`!4) `1Imm trust.`7

Zach brought up the point that we, as Imms, have a lot of trust to regain with the players.  Though none of our current (active) staff has really ever abused that trust as far as I know, there is a long history of staff distrust that we have to overcome, because a lot of our players have long memories.  It isn't necessarily fair that we will be held to a standard based on the actions of previous Imms, but we will be, and missteps will serve to reinforce bad feelings on behalf of the playerbase.

Overcoming this is simple, but not easy.  First and foremost, we need to say what we mean and mean what we say - basically make promises and keep them.  Secondly, we should be as transparent as possible without endangering plots or player characters.  Third, we should be clear about our boundaries: our immranks should mean what they say and we should each respect the domains of the others - Ayasha is HEAD Building and Story, and has the final say on zones and plotlines, Anazail is HEAD Shadow and has final say on Shadowy stuffs, I've got Guilds and would like final say on Human Resources - but we should all be sharing our (non-secret) stuff with each other because none of it is totally independent.

Semi-harmless pranks, pointless fights, drinking and debauchery became a way of life for him, but did not endear him to his neighbors.

Rags travelled widely and tried his hand at a number of professions and tasks before always moving on to something else soon after beginning.  Roughly four years after starting, he finally came to settle down at the White Tower with the notion of becoming a famed warrior.   The fighting he excelled at, although the lack of discipline significantly hindered his training, find him in hot water more often than not. 
Even so, Ragnar's training progressed, and by his twenty third year he had completed training at the white tower and found himself bonded to Ealasaid Sedai of the Blue Ajah.
The arrangement worked for roughly two years. Although his flighty and undisciplined nature made him rather unsuitable as a warder in the long term, it was a task he took seriously and excelled at in the short term. Or at least, his Aes Sedai didn't die.
After three years, though, Ragnar's feet itched to wander again and he and Ealasaid parted ways. Though still bonded, and often silently watching over her from the dream, they have spent the last five years tentatively avoiding one another.
It was in the first year of the absence that he began noticing the wolves.  Most of Ragnar's life was spent on the outer edge of society, preferring the lack of laws and lawmen, and upon the road while travelling, and it was here in the woods that he began exploring his connection to the wolves. 
At first as a flight of fancy, the man had always imagined himself as part bear, akin to the berserkers of old, Ragnar began to track and observe a local wolf pack. It was with this pack that the wolf slowly awakened and grew, and introduced him to others nearby.
He has passed through the braem pack on several occasions (perhaps even offering to keep an eye on Liro's niece whenever he's in the White Tower), most recently wintering with them during the long months, but always he eventually moves on.

Cathbad is forced down further with that last question, "I...," willing in breath, "My knowledge, is what drives me," he says through extreme pain.  "Knowledge you will never have.  Knowledge that this age has all but forgotten, save me and mine," a small victory that.  "Though I may die, it will live on," he says with a sweet smile, but, setting his teeth, "It and my people are why I do drive myself forward."  Pulling Saidin to him, he draws of it to push himself up, simple flows of air made as columns assisting him in pushing upwards slightly, enough to tilt his head up and eye Tiernan.  "I have knowledge you will never know," he says through gritted teeth, a crazed smile on his face.


Flows of Air?  No.  Cathbad gets enough of the One Power to taste the sweet bitterness of life in the back of his throat and not a molecule more before Tiernan slams the shield down so hard into the connection between the Illuminator and Saidin that it is a small wonder that barrier didn't carve itself into place with an audible ring of power.  Without releasing Cathbad from his pressure against the floor, Tiernan stands with a sigh and walks all the way back around the desk to the throne-like chair, dropping himself into it with a slight huff.  "Light you would be one of those.  Look, kid," on the word 'kid', the Earth weave lifts, allowing the wilder to breathe as he will once more, and even get up if he wishes.  "Everyone has knowledge someone else will never know.  Maybe yours is even super special secret knowledge.  But if you think that even holding the secret to blowing stuff up is in any way impressive to most of the people around here, you need to take a long hard look around and think again."    [Tiernan]

Lifting his heels back up to the desktop again, Tiernan seems perfectly at ease in this ostentatious room, though it doesn't really fit his casual mannerisms.  "There are men here who know things that would make your brain run out your ears, men who know things about how to literally melt a man's heart in his chest, men who have endured more torture, pain, solitude, sickness, madness, and desolation than any twenty men who know things no human should ever -have- to know."  Earnestly, if flatly, he continues, "Your knowledge may be important to you - maybe even the Pattern itself - but it doesn't impress anyone but you.  Thinking otherwise is more arrogant than half the Asha'man in a room together.  You can't even eat without someone's permission right now, and I'm a little concerned that you're going to stop getting that if you keep up like this."  He sits up once more and leans forward intently.  "We. Are not. Your enemy.  You are.  Shape up and get over yourself or you won't leave this humble farm alive."  [Tiernan]


Cathbad draws in breath, through pain and suffering, at being shielded a second time.  He glances up where the shield cut him off, gritting his teeth.  Stretching his shoulders square, Cathbad draws himself more upright, though remains in the kneeling position.  His eyes shift to his staff, then back to Tiernan as he is lectured to.  "And you have to realize that my only wish here is to not have the bloody Power try to drowned me in it when I'm annoyed."  Taking a breath he calms down and states, "Everything else, is secondary."  With that, he leans on his staff to draw him up as far as the chair, and reseats himself upon it.


Tiernan listens actively to Cathbad's response, then shakes his head.  "That's where you're wrong.  You might -think- that's your only wish, but it isn't.  You've got too much pride, too much ego, too much of yourself wrapped up who you are outside of here."  The Dedicated does not release the Power, and certainly doesn't release the thick shield he has firmly in place on the wilder.  "Starting right now, if you think you really want to learn, you need to forget your life away from the Black Tower.  -This- is your life.  You were born here, you will live here, you will die here.  This isn't no ride through the country.  We're not going to break your block for you and just let you go.  Even if some rules have been bent in keeping you alive, we're not here to set a bunch of untrained, irresponsible children out into the world with the power to break it."

His tone softens just a touch, but his hard, flat eyes continue staring at Cathbad.  "You're ours now.  You belong to the Dragon Reborn.  Any life you think you are getting back to?  Forget that life.  The person you were before you got here?  That person is dead now.  There is one way out of this, and that way is death."  Without a hint of threat, Tiernan adds, "If that option suits you better, I can oblige.  But I'm offering you the choice of either the purposeful life we can prov

No.  Cathbad gets enough of the One Power to taste the sweet bitterness of life in the back of his throat and not a molecule more before Tiernan slams the shield down so hard into the connection between the Illuminator and Saidin that it is a small wonder that barrier didn't carve itself into place with an audible ring of power.  Without releasing Cathbad from his pressure against the floor, Tiernan stands with a sigh and walks all the way back around the desk to the throne-like chair, dropping himself into it with a slight huff.  "Light you would be one of those.  Look, kid," on the word 'kid', the Earth weave lifts, allowing the wilder to breathe as he will once more, and even get up if he wishes.  "Everyone has knowledge someone else will never know.  Maybe yours is even super special secret knowledge.  But if you think that even holding the secret to blowing stuff up is in any way impressive to most of the people around here, you need to take a long hard look around and think again."    [Tiernan]

Lifting his heels back up to the desktop again, Tiernan seems perfectly at ease in this ostentatious room, though it doesn't really fit his casual mannerisms.  "There are men here who know things that would make your brain run out your ears, men who know things about how to literally melt a man's heart in his chest, men who have endured more torture, pain, solitude, sickness, madness, and desolation than any twenty men who know things no human should ever -have- to know."  Earnestly, if flatly, he continues, "Your knowledge may be important to you - maybe even the Pattern itself - but it doesn't impress anyone but you.  Thinking otherwise is more arrogant than half the Asha'man in a room together.  You can't even eat without someone's permission right now, and I'm a little concerned that you're going to stop getting that if you keep up like this."  He sits up once more and leans forward intently.  "We. Are not. Your enemy.  You are.  Shape up and get over yourself or you won't leave this humble farm alive."  [Tiernan]


Cathbad draws in breath, through pain and suffering, at being shielded a second time.  He glances up where the shield cut him off, gritting his teeth.  Stretching his shoulders square, Cathbad draws himself more upright, though remains in the kneeling position.  His eyes shift to his staff, then back to Tiernan as he is lectured to.  "And you have to realize that my only wish here is to not have the bloody Power try to drowned me in it when I'm annoyed."  Taking a breath he calms down and states, "Everything else, is secondary."  With that, he leans on his staff to draw him up as far as the chair, and reseats himself upon it.


Tiernan listens actively to Cathbad's response, then shakes his head.  "That's where you're wrong.  You might -think- that's your only wish, but it isn't.  You've got too much pride, too much ego, too much of yourself wrapped up who you are outside of here."  The Dedicated does not release the Power, and certainly doesn't release the thick shield he has firmly in place on the wilder.  "Starting right now, if you think you really want to learn, you need to forget your life away from the Black Tower.  -This- is your life.  You were born here, you will live here, you will die here.  This isn't no ride through the country.  We're not going to break your block for you and just let you go.  Even if some rules have been bent in keeping you alive, we're not here to set a bunch of untrained, irresponsible children out into the world with the power to break it."

His tone softens just a touch, but his hard, flat eyes continue staring at Cathbad.  "You're ours now.  You belong to the Dragon Reborn.  Any life you think you are getting back to?  Forget that life.  The person you were before you got here?  That person is dead now.  There is one way out of this, and that way is death."  Without a hint of threat, Tiernan adds, "If that option suits you better, I can oblige.  But I'm offering you the choice of either the purposeful life we can prov

Of course, you're more than welcome to work Jezz into the upcoming event.  :)

The two Sedai rooms is fine.  We are building a barracks for Unbonded Warders
and for the Tower Guard, but Sedai are welcome to have their Gaidin link a room
to their rooms if they wish.  Makes IC sense.  

As for the secret exits, I am thinking this would not be very realistic.  Every
Sitter room would need a secret exit into the Sitter halls, and this would just
be too many exits linking to the same rooms.  So, my answer on this is that the
Sitters will need to make do with their separate offices, without secret
entrances.  

The best I could do is maybe do like what was done with the secret ways into
the basements, and do a statue or an orb with a teleporter leading up to the Sitter
floor, but it would be in the hallways, not from the inividual Sitter rooms.

Hi Jai-butt
 
 I have some paintings that you can use around the tower.  They're both from my Jezz website, not sure if I gave you the link or not. You can color them in, and what not. Now that Jezz is back, she'll start painting again and I'll send you what I come up with. I have one that was commissioned to Phaedra, but I need to make an adjustment to it. The one given to her, Sabs and Kinje conspired to make a slight adjustment to it. I need to remove the adjustment.

 A small framed painting is clearly of an Altaran lass, her prominent features are her large, dark eyes and pouty pink lips. Her dark hair flows just to shoulder-length with shadings of an afternoon sun kissing her features. The painting itself has aged some while the young woman herself wears the dress of an accepted. Hanging from a leather thong around her neck is a pierced Illianer coin which casts a glint from a ray of sun touching the edge. A small blossom rests in her hands which she seems preoccupied with while around her are the blurred images of a garden. In the corner, the artist squiggle is JJaeyen

`
 A small framed painting of a tower trained gent and a bushy, brown wolfhound with doleful brown eyes. The Murandian-dressed fellow is seated in a plush, red chair with a book in one hand and his sword laying across his lap, the background is faded out which could be construed as a library. A lamp light highlights the side of his clean shaven features.  At his feet, the large wolfhound is resting its chin on the man's knee. In the corner, the artist squiggle is JJaeyen

 Jezz has one very similar to this in her bedroom (or will when Ayasha updates it), so, if someone really looks at it, it's a version 2.

Heyas, I've been thinking about joining the Band for a while now, but
here's my official application.

Kagari Yurehl was born on a ranch near Four Kings. Her mother having
died when she was young, Kagari was raised by her father, with a little
help from a neighboring widow. Never properly learning a woman's ways,
Kagari became quite a tomboy. She helped her father with the horses
until a barnyard fire left him crippled. They sold the breeding stock
to make it through the harsh winter, and in the spring, Kagari began
working as a courrier instead, taking messages and packages sometimes
as far as Aringill.

While travelling through the woods one day, Kagari was attacked by a
lone trolloc which had somehow made its way south. She was rescued by
a pair of wolves, who spoke in her mind and told her to fight. She
was frightened at first, but has come to accept her connection to the
wolves and the abilities she now has. (Guilded Wolfkin, rank Young.)

Through her interactions with the wolves and occasional encounters
with the Dragon Reborn's Asha'man, Kagari has become convinced that
she must ready herself to fight in the Last Battle. She has minimal
sword training (WM1 on the old code) and can ride a horse like she
was born on one. Additionally, she has all the unique abilities of
a slightly experienced Wolfkin. She would probably make a fine scout,
though her dream is to join the cavalry.

You cannot have both of your alts involved in the same RP.  Period.  

Perrin is in GHEALDAN.  Miniver was lucky to have heard that Sending.  Granted,
wolves may have spread the word of the incident, but Perrin is hunting for HIS
KIDNAPPED WIFE.  

In the books, Perrin is obsessed with finding Faile.  If anything, he would be
using the wolf dream to scout out the Shaido camp, NOT some hill way far away
southeast of Caemlyn.  

Please review POLICY BOOKIE.  One of the points I made there when updating that
file is that players who take on book characters are expected to play their
characters in accordance with the characters from the books.  

Do you really think Perrin would leave Faile to certain death and torture, to
go off chasing rumors about something else?  

The books say no.  Perrin is nearly insane with terror for what is going to
happen to Faile, and is very near to losing himself to the wolf.  He's so
obsessed with it that everything else is secondary.  

Finally, like I said, I am going to be running a very large event JUST FOR
PERRIN.  I am going through a lot of trouble to do so.  Please be patient, and
you'll reap the rewards.  We will get Perrin on the grid eventually.  But you
can't violate our policies by having two alts involved in the same storyline,
and doing something that would be out of character for Perrin.  

I'm sorry if I'm getting upset, but you just don't seem to understand, and I
don't know how to get through to you.  

This is the final word on the matter.  Perrin cannot be involved in the
investigation of the hill.  Miniver is more than welcome to investigate in TAR
with Wyl and Ragnarr, and whoever else you want.  But not Perrin.

I want to give you a head's up that in the next few days I will be providing you revision notes for your syllabi.  I have your weave lists for lessons and advancement and simply based on current `&and future`7 code requirements, some of the weaves you have will need to be adjusted.  It won't be a `&huge`7 difference, but - for example - there are some weaves which will have restricted/limited access based on talents which should not be included as standard requirements since not all your guildies will have the talents necessary.

Where changes need to be made, I will include replacement suggestions when possible.

I will also be giving a very basic description of the "standard" way in which the weave should be formed so that teaching and use will be relatively consistent across the board.  On this, they will be `&very`7 basic and should in no way limit the expression of any given channeler's emotive ability, and I will happily accept suggestions from you about weave structure if the form provided is not in line with how you feel the weave should be woven.  (I don't foresee this being an issue, but I didn't want you to be surprised or think I am trying to 'change' the way you do things.)

If any current character already has knowledge of any restricted/limited access weave ICly, adjustments will need to be made, and I will be more than happy to help construct that adjustment if you need it.

I'll repeat most of this when my corrections are sent, I just didn't want to take you by surprise or make you feel like I'm "forcing" changes on you.  These alterations will be `&very`7 minor, all things considered, and will prevent confusion in future when IC and code become linked more firmly again.

Of course I will leave it totally up to you to provide the updated information to your guilds/adjust your syllabi when the changes are made.

Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime!

Warder Template #1 - The Righteous
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Righteous "For the Light against the Dark"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are the more common types of candidates seeking to train with 
the warders. These are people with high ideals and goals for themselves 
and their own place in the Wheel. At some point or another they have 
decided that they wish to fight against the Dark One: even though some 
of the more erratic of these seek themselves to the Children of the Light, 
those without prejudice finds themselves in Tar Valon.
`
These people feel that the best way to fight against the Shadow is by 
the Aes Sedai's side. The Last Battle requires the use of the One Power, 
and Tar Valon is the obvious fortress of justice in these regards. They 
are blindly devoted to the cause, and trust in the cause whatever means 
are used along the way. 
`
The Righteous makes a good Warder. He believes in what he does 
without question. This may even be his flaw: without questioning the 
mind gets no room for growth. Yet for the purpose of Tar Valon a man 
of this devotion would serve quite well.
`
`
Warder Template # 2 - The Romantic 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Romantic "I want to be a hero too!"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
`
Dazzled by old stories of heroism against the battle of evil, the 
Romantic dwells within all the elaborated myths about the Gaidin. This 
one wants to be a hero first and foremost. Naturally with this comes a 
degree of wishing to contribute, though often this trait is overshadowed 
by the urge to be special and important. 
`
This kind of person is often grandiose in nature. He is more 
self-preserved than The Righteous, more concerned with his own 
progression and faith rather than those around him. He may even be 
somewhat naive, and could also fail to comprehend the full extent of 
what being a Warder entails. By no means a selfish person, he may on 
occasion find himself too engrossed with his own self and maybe not 
contributing in the way other people might expect. Still, these men's 
bravery often matches that of The Righteous', and makes a good 
contribution to the ranks.
`
`
Warder Template # 3 - The Dutiful 
------------------------------------------------------------
The Dutiful "My Duty is My Life"
------------------------------------------------------------
`
Even though all Warders are supposed to live by their duty, many of 
them apply this in various ways from person to person. This one lives 
only for his Duty. There is a small urge to be a part of something large, 
yet in the end, be it for the Light or personal reasons, the Duty is what 
counts. 
`
These men often arrive at the White Tower completely clear and 
confident in what they wish to do, and what role they are to partake in. 
There is little passion outside the cold brim of duty, and these are in 
truth the "Cold, Leashed Dogs" of the Gaidin that most people hear 
about. They often see themselves more as tools than maybe the Aes 
Sedai does, not caring much for their own value and often quite morbid 
in nature.
`
`
Warder Template # 4 - The Cryptic 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Cryptic "I do what I do for my own reasons"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`
Many kinds of people fit into this category, yet what all of these are 
bound to have in common is the fact that at one point or another, 
something happened in their lives that made them feel like repaying it 
in a way by joining the Gaidin. Maybe some Aes Sedai helped this one 
in the past in a way, and as compensation, he decided to repay this 
favor by becoming a Gaidin. As all personal experience, the event that 
led their path to the Shining walls varies as the colors of the rainbow.
`
Their personalities are a very mixed lot: there is hardly one that is the 
other alike. But driven by personal reasons to pursue extensive training, 
others may be suspicious of their true potential as Gaidin. They are 
sometimes very unpredictable.
`
`
TG Template #1 - The Devoted 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Devoted "To Defend the Shining Walls till my last breath"

more structured life-style in the army instead. The guidance of the army 
is like a beacon for these, clear

These men are often rather simple in terms of personality.  They are often

`
TG\Army Template #3 - The Obligated (Honor and Tradition, Nobles)
The Nobility are often in the habit of sending their sons to be trained 
at the White Tower. These sons are sometimes the heirs of their

while others may return home to their families.

Personal Tower rooms
I'm looking for Jaiana's room, which would be in the yellow ajah halls, and Esrahd's room, he was a TG when he had his room. Not sure what zones they would be located in off the BP. 

Thanks for looking into it.

Heya, 

Jezz is asking me to find Jaiana and Esrahd's rooms, but I am not finding them
on the builder port.  They were not in zone 88 either, which had Sedai rooms. 
Is it possible that there was yet another zone being used for Tower rooms?  If
so, would it be possible to find it?  If not, I can just ask them to write me
descs for new rooms.  

Thanks,

Can we just delete all the shops?  Since I have to do the ones I did over
anyway, I might as well start from scratch.  I don't know how to delete the
ones I did.  They got ported over when you changed your room, because they are
in zone 0 so now they are all on the main port and they weren't ready to be
ported.  

It won't take me long to re-do them in their proper zones.  It will be easier
if I can just sedit <vnum> as I go along, instead of relying on that
ridiculously long list in show shops.  Most of those 'shops' aren't even shops
anyway, as we discussed earlier on the wiz channel.  

Once we find a way to get all the shops deleted, I can make shops match up with
room numbers, and then hopefully show shops will only show shops that are
actual shops, instead of a bunch of random vnums.  

I hope this makes sense.

No, I don't need a report on every room that doesn't have an actual desc. 
There are zones that were ported over incomplete back when Nicodemus was in
charge of the Ubermap.  Only the rooms directly surrounding the major cities
were desc'd, and all the others were left as 'The Open World'.  I definitely
don't need reports on those.  

We are still working those zones.  If you would really like to help, I would be
more than happy to set you up on the builder port as a mort builder, and you
can help me take a crack at them.  It is a huge project, and I've been working
at it, but there have been other priorities, such as getting Ghealdan set up
for very immediate war RP needs, and getting the shop code to work properly.  

Right now, I've just finished Ghealdan, and am working on a couple of towns. 
After that, it will be linked up with the old Two Rivers zone, Baerlon,
Whitebridge and Four Kings.  This will probably happen within the next week or
so.  

If you would like to help, let me know and I will set you up.  :)

Sorry, I was having really bad connection problems on my laptop.  Google Chrome
only has one MUD client that works with it, and most of the time, it doesn't work. :P

When I see you again, I'll check your eggs, and give you qps accordingly.

Surien tells you, 'As for the Blacksmiths, We have a group of people who have lived their life by the spear. The blacksmiths themselves were by far the people amongst them who perpetuated the oathbreaking the most, albeit ignorantly, however that doesn't make it less so in their eyes. I feel that the sense of their honor, would take precedent in their thoughts, causing them to wanting to break ties with that job. My character would have been one based on his own inner struggles more so than a normal character would. That may not be the best for a group RP setting, but would have been one, I would have identified with the most. That being said, once again, Rand's coming brought about a change in the way Aiel society was thought, and not just by the Aiel as a people, but with the Aiel as individual human beings. I just can't see an entire group going to a preset group of options, and staying within those bounds as far as the choices they make. I believe that a small percentage chose their own path, and followed it in their fashion.'
`
Surien tells you, 'Readers digest condensed version, (since i'm tired of retyping it) We have 2 different theories on the Aiel themselves, and due to your position of power, and having final matter in the say, I understand mine doesn't matter. (Nowhere near as bitchy as it sounds, just exasperation to being disconnected again. Is there any way to fix that in coding? I'm sure that gets annoying in some of the RP)'
`
Surien tells you, 'As far as leaving, He didn't leave on his own. he left with the group to chase down the Shaido, as did thousands of other Aiel. It was during this time that he was still dealing with the bleakness, and subsequently came across Aes Sedai in their travels. There were an abundance around the camp of the Car'a'carn, even if they weren't specifically with Rand. It's not too much of a stretch for him to have been able to present himself to one at their camp. As for helping the dragon, Isee the wording is wrong, but regardless, the sentiment is there. The last battle is coming, and they wanted people to be able to fight. I would think a green would think strategically, and want an Aiel to be fighting, and not being Gai'shain to them.'
`
Surien tells you, 'And channeling, to be honest, I stated I would like for him to be able to at some point. If it doesn't happen in a game mechanic fashion, then I understand. but everone has a place where they would like to see a character go. I would like for my guy to be able to make Powerwrought spears. No super deathgates, no lightning strikes, or a churning of the earth to grind his enemies. Just a blacksmith making a line of legendary spears. '

that it is entirely probable I will be in and out of my wifi area so I may be dropping

I don't want you to think I am ignoring you. I miss you.

As you and your nine researchers begin the process of deciphering the
Old Tongue in the library text regarding the Shain'vadin, other possibly
familiar words stand out, namely numerous references to the 'tia avende 
alentin'.  In other words, it is pretty easy to assume that the Peace 
Shield is an early reference to the Ogier steddings.  There are also references 
to the Nym, who cultivated the farmlands and gardens of the Age of Legends, 
and who worked alongside the Ogier and the Da'shain Aiel.  The book goes 
on to discuss the Nym, and describes them as constructs who were designed
to assist with growing things.  There are numerous arguments detailed in
the discussion, namely about the ethics of creating such sentient creatures,
and whether or not it is appropriate to refer to them as people or things.

Eventually, they were given into the care of the Ogier, who fiercely wanted
to protect them from potential exploitation for monetary gain.
The article goes into great detail about how the steddings were created,
and why.  Apparently the Ogier were discomfited by the growth of human
population, and they were becoming increasingly worried about the effects
the One Power was having on the earth.  They wanted assurances that some
places would remain untouched by the One Power, and that they would be
allowed to live in peace and tend to the land, and to protect the Nym.  

The Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends built the stedding as a sort of treaty 
with the Ogier. It was apparently a great endeavor which took many years to 
perfect, using both halves of the True Source, both Saidar and Saidin with 
great circles of linked channelers along with the singing of a song.  The
lyrics of the song are not mentioned in the text.

Some of this translation is true, and some of it is not translated
correctly due to the 1 you rolled on your last week's research roll.
Some of it is from actual references in the Wheel of Time books,
and some of it I made up, because this is a mirror world, and we
really don't know a whole lot about the Age of Legends.  Just because
I made something up, doesn't mean it isn't true. :)

we can do arches tonight, or tomorrow during the day.  going to use your test, we'll just copy and

BTW, I think Kieryn and Kendrick would be an adorable bonded pair.

`7Date`6:`7 Tue May 21 10:50:40 2013
`7From`6:`7 Ayasha
`7Subj`6:`7 Regarding Tuon
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
First of all, I would like to start this off by saying that at this time, I
am not approving anyone to play Tuon, and here are the reasons why:

1.  Tuon is the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Heir to the Crystal Throne. 
She is destined to become the Empress of Seanchan when her mother dies, and is
therefore, one of the three most powerful characters in the books (next to
Rand, and the Amyrlin Seat.)  So we can't give her out lightly.  

2.  Tuon is motivated by a number of subtle omens and prophecies, and this
requires a strong knowledge of what those omens and prophecies are.  Reading
the books is vital to understanding Tuon, and whoever ends up playing her needs
to be familiar with these things.  

This is not to say that I will never approve anyone, or you, to play Tuon. 
It's just that we need to be very discriminating, due to her importance.  My
main concern is knowing that I can feel she is being played accurately and true
to character.  

So, with that in mind, here are the answers to your questions:

1.  Mat and Tuon's marriage.  As of right now, Mat and Tuon are not technically
married in accordance with Seanchan custom.  Mat has told Tuon three times that
she is his wife.  But, the marriage is not complete until Tuon reciprocates in
kind.  She has to tell him in return that he is her husband in order for them
to be properly married.  

2.  Flirting.  Tuon does flirt with Mat, but her manner of flirting is very
odd.  Usually when Mat does something to make her mad, she does vindictive
little things like telling the entire camp that they are under her
protection...  Except Mat.  Or, she calls him Toy, or she makes veiled threats
that she doesn't really mean.  For Tuon, this is flirting.  But at the same
time, one gets the sense that she could really do him harm if she really wanted
to.  (She is an expert martial artist in hand fighting, and she nearly bested
Mat with only her hands and feet when they first met.)  

3.  Friendly relationships.  I would never call the relationship between Mat
and Tuon 'friendly'.  There is always some underlying threat beneath her words
and actions, which always makes Mat nervous in the books.  It's very hard to
tell.  But Tuon does seem pleased when Mat says that she is his wife three
times, and enjoyed a kiss she gave him while checking to see if he had a fever.
So there is some kind of affection going on between them.  

4.  Leaving the wagon.  Trying to tell Tuon she isn't 'allowed' to do something
is likely to end up with bad results.  Mat may have kidnapped her, but never
forget that Tuon is motivated by omens and prophecy.  Nothing she does
(including allowing Mat to carry her off) is without a purpose.  If she wanted
to leave the wagon, she would do so, and there really isn't much Mat could do
to stop her if she really set her mind to it.  But she never tries to escape,
because she doesn't consider herself a prisoner.  She is waiting to see how
the prophecy unfolds.

5.  Personality.  Tuon has a very unique personality.  In many ways, she is a
stickler for proper protocol, but Mat, and the Oathbreakers, tend to ignore
Seanchan protocol and etiquette, and so she has been forced to adjust. 
However, as mentioned above, she tends to find other little manipulative and
vindictive methods to get what she wants.  Once she returns to her people, very
likely she will revert to her usual adherence to etiquette and protocol.

6. Description.  Tuon will come with a desc, if I approve her to be played.  I set up
all of the book characters before giving the temp password to the player.  However, the
desc can be changed to suit.  Here is the desc I used when I played her:

This slender young woman stands perhaps no taller than a mere five feet 
in height, and surely cannot be older than sixteen summers. She may never 
be considered imposing, due to her height and youthful appearance, yet she 
carries herself with a calm, quiet grace, her expression almost always 
composed into a stern mask. Expressive, liquid brown eyes gaze out from 
beneath a pair of elegantly arched eyebrows of raven black. Those eyes 
are strangely cool and calculating, despite the apparent youth of the young 
lady's face, and seem to miss very little. Fringed with dark lashes, those 
eyes are likely the most alluring of this young woman's features. Her skin 
is an exotic shade of dark bronze, smooth and flawless, accentuating her 
deep brown eyes. High, proud cheekbones and a noble brow, together with a 
small but elegant nose in a heart-shaped face give her a regal, yet youthful 
beauty. A pair of delicate, bow-shaped lips seem to soften her features 
somewhat deceptively. The young woman's beauty cannot be meas

`7Subj`6:`7 the letter she sends to Rowena in a few days
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
*given to Kindra at the Merry Company* 
*whom was asked to deliver this to Rowena*
`
*written in a neat and flowing hand*
`
Dearest Rowena, 
`
I pray that this letter finds you well.  I have been worried about you since the
attack.  The strength that you posess is inspiring.  I can only hope that I can
learn the kind of strength that you display.  I know that Thrain would be quite
happy if I did.  
`
Thrain.  The man confounds me.  Part of me is angry with him for every thing that
has happened while the other part of me is not.  I know I was a fool for rushing 
off with him when he found me in Tanchico.  I was scared, and younger, not that I
am so old now, naiive would be a more appropriate word I think.  I thank the Light
that he was not the man who ended Dahmot's life.  I do not know if the man who had
attacked us, Saita, is alive or dead.  I do not have the courage to ask.  I also
do not feel that Thrain would tell me if he remained alive.  
`
Thrain insists that I attempt to rebuild my life, to start anew, here, in Andor.
I know that is for the best but the aspect of this frightens me terribly.  I have
never been exactly independant or alone before and so I am still taking help from
Thrain.  I have moved from the Crown of Roses to a different Inn, The Lion Banner.
It's proximity to the Palace and consequently the Queen's Guard seemed to be the
safest place.  I do not know where he is staying, he felt it would be better for
me to not know.  
`
There has been discussion that I should learn to use a blade, a small one of course
as I do not think I could manage anything larger than a dagger.  I did find a job.
Yes you may laugh.  I know as I write this I am amused that the spoiled child of
noble merchants is now working for a seamstress.  At least I might finally begin
to understand Andoran fashion.  
`
Respectfully yours,
            Asrah

Heya,

You are more than welcome to build a camp for the Band.  In fact,

stuff going on, and a camp will be needed.  I have actually been
thinking about this, but don't have the time to do it myself, and haven't
really got a good idea on what you guys might want.

So, if you want to build it, I can set up a zone for you to build it in,
give you access to the builder port, and show you the ropes of how to build.
Or, you can just email me the descs again like you did with the Embassy,
and I can do the work needed on the builder port.

Tell me how many rooms you think you will need, and I'll get a zone set up
for it either way.  And let me know if you want to build it yourself,
or if you just want to send me the descs.  Ideally, it would be better
if you did the building on the builder port.  I'm happy to show you how. :)

Hi!

So I have finally gotten my brain back into gear (and out of first gear, because you need to
eventually shift to second if you're going further than a block) and remembered to mail in
when people need their skills set!  I know it's amazing Isa's player remembered something!
(fanfare can be heard, lovely little colored flags also dance in the wind!)

So here's the first two characters who may need things set as I tried to teach them with
the lesson code and it wouldn't let me, how fun is that?

Kieryn, Aes Sedai, Blue Ajah (I forgot to ask her what her talents were, bad on me)
skills - weave, grasp, release, tie, link, and read/write old tongue
weaves - basic as grouping plus what she's learned via rp - slice weave, shield source, 
bond, gate, plant growth, create food, attract insects, refresh, light, dome of air, 
lightining, protection, water, gag, wrap, still, air blindness, project voice.  
(fairly certain that this is all of them for Kieryn.)


Second character - Alika Chienar - Instructor for Warders Guild, Tower Guard

talents - 
hunter..............100% 
        talent endurance....100%
        talent fast healer..100% 
talent affinity for weapons.100%

As for skills I know she's got dagger on her char but she should also have

`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
Hi!

So I have finally gotten my brain back into gear (and out of first gear, because you need to
eventually shift to second if you're going further than a block) and remembered to mail in
when people need their skills set!  I know it's amazing Isa's player remembered something!
(fanfare can be heard, lovely little colored flags also dance in the wind!)

So here's the first two characters who may need things set as I tried to teach them with
the lesson code and it wouldn't let me, how fun is that?

Kieryn, Aes Sedai, Blue Ajah (I forgot to ask her what her talents were, bad on me)
skills - weave, grasp, release, tie, link, and read/write old tongue
weaves - basic as grouping plus what she's learned via rp - slice weave, shield source, 
bond, gate, plant growth, create food, attract insects, refresh, light, dome of air, 
lightining, protection, water, gag, wrap, still, air blindness, project voice.  
(fairly certain that this is all of them for Kieryn.)


Second character - Alika Chienar - Instructor for Warders Guild, Tower Guard

talents - 
hunter..............100% 
        talent endurance....100%
        talent fast healer..100% 
talent affinity for weapons.100%

As for skills I know she's got dagger on her char but she should also have
sneak, hide, search, sword, staff, bow - at the least.  

oh sorry there's another WD Char, Jaager.  He's also an Instructor but I haven't been
able to talk to him to see if he needs to be set.

that's all the business, I hope it helps.  

Thank you for doing all that you do!

Some of the flags have not been porting over correctly.  I'll have to fix this when I get

one MUD window open at a time with ChroMUD and I need both windows open to do a copyover.
Or, you could get Duren or Anazail to just copyover zone 670 again.  It should fix.

`7Subj`6:`7 Soldier goings on
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
So, since I've not had much Soldier RP as far as lessons,
there are a few questions which would have come up
during the >Month?< of time that Cath's been a Soldier.

1.  Is there a way for many Asha'man to link their power together to accomplish even greater tasks?

2.  Can one begin maintaining a tied-off weave again, and retie the not to extend the duration it is carried?

3.  How would I funnel air from one area to another?  ( move steam / smoke from where you are to location further away)

4.  How would I gate to a location you can't see and don't know well, like the inside of a building?

5.  May I have a small area at the edge of camp, away from most, to make some destructive items based on my Illuminator 

knowledge?

    A.  If so, I will need to gather supplies?  Can a gate for me be made,
    and a wagon be made available for my use?

    B.  I'll need to be the only one to handle them for now,
    as they'll be quite dangerous for the untrained.

Also, Cath probably could make a Shield Source weave, as he was repeatedly subjected to it
for a long while after he arrived at the Farm.  (Some of the initial blockbreak attempsts
were releasing from his shield, making him angry, with instructions not to grasp...
and he was shielded when that failed.)

I'd really like to have some lessons with Cath, too,
but until that occurs, these will have to do.

Hoping for more Asha RP,

These are questions that Cath has brought up to Ryn:

1.  Could we try linking?  If we're ever going to,
it'd be best to practice, so we know what we're doing
when the situation is dire.

2.  Do you think the reason for Saidin and Saidar
behave so different is unchanging, or could it be due
to the Dark One's Taint having affected it
all these years?

3.  On the blueprints for weaves:
    Do any of these seem familiar?

    A.  Drawing of:
    A sphere of a flow of air, wrapped up in a sphere,
    with the end of a fire flow inside.
    Also, an indication of knotting it off.

B.  Drawing of:
A fire flow being split time and again to thin strands,
at right angles, forming a mesh net over a surface,
or wrapping an object.

C.  A sharpened tip of air, with a heavily twisted
coil of air behind it, with the coil then seperated,
with the tip flying forward with great force.

D.  A lattice of Spirit, the forward edge a blunted
shape.

Well, there goes.  Hope some of these inspire
RP, but if not, at least we're getting some of these
questions out of the way. :p

`7Subj`6:`7 Phase 1: Results
`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7
`7CC`6: `7Aldor Larissa 

These are the results of your 'feeling out' which Houses are loyal
to Rand, plus some extra information.  Use it as you see fit.  Let me
know when you want to start Phase 2.  I am willing to NPC any nobles you
might wish to try to convince to join your cause.

`2House Damodred`7
.
Currently, Caraline Damodred is the High Seat of House Damodred.
She is currently in Tear, assisting Lord Darlin Sisnera with his
rebellion against Rand.  Caraline Damodred has sworn allegience
to Rand, as has Darlin Sisnera, but things become complicated here
because the people of Tear want Darlin as their King, and this is
the source of the rebellion in Tear. It is said that Darlin Sisnera 
is currently trying to woo Caraline, but she has thus far refused his 
advances.  She has left Larissa 'in charge' while she is away, but
this does not make Larissa the official head of the House in all
matters. Caraline could return at any time to reclaim her rights
as High Seat.
.
.
`2House Riatin`7
.
Toram Riatin was the High Seat of House Riatin.  It is said that
before he disappeared, he had hired the remnants of the White
Lions from Andor to fill out the ranks of his rebel army during
the civil war, before Rand restored order to Cairhien.  This
army was either dispersed or killed in the midst of some strange,
unnatural fog south of Cairhien. Toram's whereabouts are currently
unknown, and so his sister, Ailil Riatin, has taken charge of the
House for now.  It is said that she is loyal to Rand, unlike her
brother, but one never knows with House Riatin.
.
.
`2House Saighan`7
.
Bertome Saighan is currently the High Seat of House Saighan, and
he is one of the most powerful men in Cairhien.  He is cousin to
the late Lady Colavaere Saighan, who's attempt to take the Sun
Throne ended with Rand expelling her to a farm, and her subsequent
suicide.  Bertome considers his cousin to have been overly ambitious.
He doesn't like Rand, because of what he did to Colavaere, but he is, 
however, currently neutral on the matter of who should rule
Cairhien.  Cautious might be a better word.  Bertome is a patriot,
and ultimately loyal to Cairhien above all else.
.
.
`2House Taborwin`7
.
One of the major Houses in Cairhien, House Taborwin is led by Dobraine,
who is also currently Rand's Steward over Cairhien.  He is loyal to
Rand, and one of the Dragon's most trusted advisors.  He is holding
the Sun Throne for Elayne with the help of several Aes Sedai, the
support of a number of minor Houses, and the Aiel?  He led the
Cairhienin in the Battle of Dumai's Wells.  It is said that Dobraine
believes in keeping to the letter of his oaths, and he cannot be
swayed from his loyalty to Rand and his duty to see Elayne set on
the Sun Throne.  Not all are happy with Dobraine ruling Cairhien.
Some might support Toram Riatin if he returns.
.
.
`2House Annallin`7
.
House Annallin is a minor House, and was in support of Colavaer when
she tried to take the Sun Throne.  However, the House's loyalties are
dubious in that they also begged assistance from the Dragon Reborn
for aid against the Shaido.
.
.
`2House Chuliandred`7
.
A House of middling power in Cairhien, they could cause trouble
for Elayne in her bid for the Sun Throne.  High Seat Doressin 
Chuliandred supported Colavaere in her attempt to gain the Sun 
Throne, but it is said that he has bent the knee to the Lord Dragon.
He and Dobraine Saighan were boyhood friends, so it is likely that
he will side with his boyhood friend in any conflicts regarding
the Sun Throne.  Another member of House Chuliandred, Lady Alaine,
is said to run around dressed in boy's clothing (like Min).  She
is married, and yet is rumored to have tried to seduce Rand.
.
.
`2House Darengil`7
.
This is a fairly minor House, and it it loyal to Rand.  Most
probably, it will side with Elayne when the time comes. (OOC: One of

pretends to act like Aiel.)

not as great as Taborwin or Saighan.

These are the results of your 'feeling out' which Houses are loyal
to Rand, plus some extra information.  Use it as you see fit.  Let me
know when you want to start Phase 2.  I am willing to NPC any nobles you
might wish to try to convince to join your cause.

`2House Damodred`7
.
Currently, Caraline Damodred is the High Seat of House Damodred.
She is currently in Tear, assisting Lord Darlin Sisnera with his
rebellion against Rand.  Caraline Damodred has sworn allegience
to Rand, as has Darlin Sisnera, but things become complicated here
because the people of Tear want Darlin as their King, and this is
the source of the rebellion in Tear. It is said that Darlin Sisnera 
is currently trying to woo Caraline, but she has thus far refused his 
advances.  She has left Larissa 'in charge' while she is away, but
this does not make Larissa the official head of the House in all
matters. Caraline could return at any time to reclaim her rights
as High Seat.
.
.
`2House Riatin`7
.
Toram Riatin was the High Seat of House Riatin.  It is said that
before he disappeared, he had hired the remnants of the White
Lions from Andor to fill out the ranks of his rebel army during
the civil war, before Rand restored order to Cairhien.  This
army was either dispersed or killed in the midst of some strange,
unnatural fog south of Cairhien. Toram's whereabouts are currently
unknown, and so his sister, Ailil Riatin, has taken charge of the
House for now.  It is said that she is loyal to Rand, unlike her
brother, but one never knows with House Riatin.
.
.
`2House Saighan`7
.
Bertome Saighan is currently the High Seat of House Saighan, and
he is one of the most powerful men in Cairhien.  He is cousin to
the late Lady Colavaere Saighan, who's attempt to take the Sun
Throne ended with Rand expelling her to a farm, and her subsequent
suicide.  Bertome considers his cousin to have been overly ambitious.
He doesn't like Rand, because of what he did to Colavaere, but he is, 
however, currently neutral on the matter of who should rule
Cairhien.  Cautious might be a better word.  Bertome is a patriot,
and ultimately loyal to Cairhien above all else.
.
.
`2House Taborwin`7
.
One of the major Houses in Cairhien, House Taborwin is led by Dobraine,
who is also currently Rand's Steward over Cairhien.  He is loyal to
Rand, and one of the Dragon's most trusted advisors.  He is holding
the Sun Throne for Elayne with the help of several Aes Sedai, the
support of a number of minor Houses, and the Aiel?  He led the
Cairhienin in the Battle of Dumai's Wells.  It is said that Dobraine
believes in keeping to the letter of his oaths, and he cannot be
swayed from his loyalty to Rand and his duty to see Elayne set on
the Sun Throne.  Not all are happy with Dobraine ruling Cairhien.
Some might support Toram Riatin if he returns.
.
.
`2House Annallin`7
.
House Annallin is a minor House, and was in support of Colavaer when
she tried to take the Sun Throne.  However, the House's loyalties are
dubious in that they also begged assistance from the Dragon Reborn
for aid against the Shaido.
.
.
`2House Chuliandred`7
.
A House of middling power in Cairhien, they could cause trouble
for Elayne in her bid for the Sun Throne.  High Seat Doressin 
Chuliandred supported Colavaere in her attempt to gain the Sun 
Throne, but it is said that he has bent the knee to the Lord Dragon.
He and Dobraine Saighan were boyhood friends, so it is likely that
he will side with his boyhood friend in any conflicts regarding
the Sun Throne.  Another member of House Chuliandred, Lady Alaine,
is said to run around dressed in boy's clothing (like Min).  She
is married, and yet is rumored to have tried to seduce Rand.
.
.
`2House Darengil`7
.
This is a fairly minor House, and it it loyal to Rand.  Most

What -I- wanted!!

Eala's throat is encased in a thick and
apparently heavy collar made of
dark, yet glittering metal. Possibly
steel, or even pure silver. It wraps
around the woman's otherwise delicate
and smooth neck, the dark metal
contrasting sharply with her pale
skin. It's rather wide, perhaps two
inches, yet she seems not to notice
the weight or thickness of it. Or
at least be hindered openly by such
a thing. Spaced evenly along each side
of her neck are dark, nearly black
stones set in thin metal prongs.
To match, at th center of her delicate
throat, is a much larger version of the
same dark stone, that catches the light
quite nicely despite it's pitch. Her
long darl hair usually hides whats
beneath, but on occassion
the lock of the collar, complete
with its own silver-linked chain
handily attached, can be seen dangling down between
her shoulderblades.

My name is Hayden Velin. I was born the youngest of 3 siblings to Jorik Velin and Merilla Velin. The owners of the Dancing Cartman Tavern in Whitebridge. As the youngest child of 3. My sister Portia is the oldest. My brother Kellan is the middle child. I am the youngest child. 

As a family, we were not poor yet by no means at all were we rich in any way, shape or form. I would say that we were middle class to well off family due to the size of our tavern and the popularity it had in Whitebridge. Everyone knew the Velin family from the nobles to the peddlers who would stay in our tavern many a night listening to the resident Gleeman.

As children, we were all expected to learn the daily activities of what it mean to run a successful tavern. However, as we got to a certain age and my parents saw where our talents were leading us. My mother made a point to get my father to support us and guide us in the direction the pattern was being woven before us. My sister, she became a seamstress and in time, the wife of the local Magisterate.

My brother, a fighter felt his calling was to join the Whitebridge Guards, and later the pull of the Light where he decided to become a Child of the Light. My father was very proud of him when he joined the Whitecloaks. I on the other hand felt uneasy by his choice for some odd reason.

I showing a talent for talking, my father began to expect that I would one day take over the tavern until I asked if I could start attending history classes with the Gleeman. I began to learn all the tales of Legends. I loved learning, and before I knew it at the age of 11, I got mother and father to start building a library in the back of the Tavern. I would use my allowance and but a book a week on any subject I could get my hands on to learn of the world.

My future was still unclear to me at the age of 15. I was still at the tavern, cleaning, cooking, serving, chopping wood, and making ale all he while reading a book. The locals would make fun of me for being a book worm. As the years began to pass, I expected that I would only see the world through books and never experience what the world would be like as a man. That all changed when I was 17 years old one night when my brother and a few of his "friends" came home to visit.

While in the main hall of the Tavern, a pair of men all in black came in and the Whitecloaks went all tense. I had heard rumors that the Dragon Reborn had in fact been found and was massing an army. The Whitecloaks began to call these men Darkfriends and tensions began to rise. A scuffle started to happen when mother was knocked down by one of the Whitecloaks and I yelled so loudly at him that it distracted everyone from the fact I had caused the beam over the group of Whitecloaks to break and snap in half with an impact of Air, I had channeled.

The Whitecloaks paid for the damages of the broken beam because they thought it happened in the scuffle where as I in fact did it. I remember getting so sick that night when the two men in black returned to speak to my parents. My mother white as a ghost walked in and began to hug and kiss me, where my father threw my clothes in a bag. I was told I would be going with these men and that I would was never to return back to Whitebridge to see my parents.

Tell me what you think

First, I think Policy Roleplay as a whole is meant for a larger playerbase of 50+. We do not have those numbers and the policy should fit for the amount of players we currently have. We have multiple players who play various characters so there is more enrichment and wordly events, otherwise, everyone would be hanging out in the White Tower.
`
If Events/Guild Departments are running an event than all in the room should be IC. It avoids passive aggressive emotes by those participating to those who are not and makes it more fun for those attending the event. 
`
I generally don't mind ooc idlers watching public RP since if they see something interesting they might join in. If we want to reduce the confusion of who is IC or OOC, than a there should be a toggle IC/OOC that can be seen in a LOOK. (It's also something I've seen on MUSH's and since Tyme is a faux MUD, it should be considered.)
`
General public RP should be fun, but by restricting mention of pop culture references in general rp is a passive-aggressive attack on those who do use those references to make their rp more fun by linking what they see someone doing to something everyone can relate to. However, if the Event/Guild Departments want a more stringent rp atmosphere, especially for rechecking logs later for discrepencies, than the policy should reflect that, allowing a more carefree RP atmosphere other times. 
`
We don't have the player base for this list of rules and stifling of RP styles. It will only serve to drive people away.

`
Aya
`
I think there is a misunderstanding somewhere.
`
Last Thursday you told me you were excited about getting the Rescue Sabine 
plot line done and we would talk about it on Friday after your interview. 
You also told me you would be on over the weekend. You didn't show up on 
Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. Sunday evening I wrote my email. I still 
didn't see you on Tyme on Monday, hence the nudge. Imagine how I felt 
being told one thing, and being flaked on. If there was a verbal "I need a 
break" message, it was never told to me. 
`
I added you to the Google docs of recent rp and the rp that had been done 
from Jezz and Cerrim leading up to our stuck spot. You wanted logs. I sent 
them to you. Please do not give me shit for doing exactly what you asked 
of me. I sent one more email giving you the heads-up about what the logs 
were about (since I wasn't able to comment on the Google doc link). I let 
you know about the email on FB because I remember you telling me once 
that you don't check that account  very often. Or maybe it was the other 
account. Hmm. I hate getting old.
`
I added Savina, despite knowing Savina couldn't do anything, because I was
drawing Wyl into it for TAR help in finding Sabine. Jezz knows Wyl, but 
not on a personal friendship level yet. I know he can't reach the place 
where dreamers are ('Gap of Infinity' is the Theoryland name for the place 
Egwene goes to find dreams.), but once we have a bead on a location, or 
a building, he could help narrow it down from clues within TAR. He's also 
got the wolves, and could help with tracking - which might come in more 
useful than anything they did in TAR. 
`
We discussed Tear. At no point did I ever say I was doing two different 
things on the same day or in the same hour, or at the same moment between 
two or three cities. Ever. I've set out a timeline for Jezz (accounting 
student and all-I budget my time), I know it can be frustrating for others 
but this is how my brain works.
`
The timeline for Tear is as follows:
`
`^-`7Go to Tear for no more than 2 days. 
Allow Vaelin to rest and give him things to do to gain his bearings and 
wits about him. Listen for rumors. Get rental. Leave for Caemlyn -- Done. 
`
Rumors I'm looking for are if there are Aiel or Aes Sedai in Tear. Period. 
According to the end of Book 10, Rand is still in Tear, or just outside. I 
would assume some Aiel are still around. Even old rumors of Aiel would be 
fine. Jezz gives zero fucks other than finding out about Aiel and Aes 
Sedai. She is in Tear to plan an assassination, not a picnic. The common 
room rp wasn't necessary. Sorry if you felt it was. 
`
If you need help determining the rumors I need, here's a suggestion.
Roll the dice. 
1-5: no useful information found in the 2 days in Tear. 
6-10: Only felt and/or seen Aes Sedai in Tear -or- Definitely no Aes Sedai.
11-15: Only saw Aiel occasionally -or- Absolutely no Aiel in Tear. 
16-20 Saw both Aiel and Aes Sedai -or- Definitely saw neither. 
Bam. Done. 
`
`^-`7Caemlyn. Save Sabine. - In progress
However long this takes IC time. Jezz wont focus on anything else than 
saving Sabine, now that they are in Caemlyn.
This includes trying to find Sabine's dream.
`
Here is my research on warded dreams:
` 
Warding dreams, according to this source, is based on the OP, and needs to 
be channeled. http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Ward
====
According to Moiraine, she wards her dreams each night without thinking:
`
"Aes Sedai learn to shield their dreams. I do it without thinking, when I 
sleep. Warders are given something much the same in the bonding. The 
Gaidin could not do what they must if the Shadow could steal into their 
dreams. We are all vulnerable when we sleep, and the Shadow is strong 
in the night."
TDR

Interview:
SHARON PERDUE
Did Egwene as Amyrlin happen to be watching people's dreams while Rand was 
shielded?
ROBERT JORDAN
I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Again?
SHARON PERDUE
Since Rand was shielded and couldn't form any wards on his dreams could 
Egwene have spied out that he was in trouble while in Tel'aran'rhiod?
ROBERT JORDAN
Ah. Yes, she could have. The problem is, when you've learned that 
something is impossible, you have a tendency to stop trying it. She just 
didn't try to spy during the period in question.
http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=26
====
Extinguishing her lamps, she wove a ward to keep her dreams from affecting 
anyone else's - that could happen with those who could channel: others 
nearby could find themselves sharing your dreams - and crawled beneath her 
blankets.

didn't see you on Tyme on Monday, hence the nudge. Imagine how I felt 
being told one thing, and being flaked on. If there was a verbal "I need a 
break" message, it was never told to me. 
`
I added you to the Google docs of recent rp and the rp that had been done 
from Jezz and Cerrim leading up to our stuck spot. You wanted logs. I sent 
them to you. Please do not give me shit for doing exactly what you asked 
of me. I sent one more email giving you the heads-up about what the logs 
were about (since I wasn't able to comment on the Google doc link). I let 
you know about the email on FB because I remember you telling me once 
that you don't check that account  very often. Or maybe it was the other 
account. Hmm. I hate getting old.
`
I added Savina, despite knowing Savina couldn't do anything, because I was
drawing Wyl into it for TAR help in finding Sabine. Jezz knows Wyl, but 
not on a personal friendship level yet. I know he can't reach the place 
where dreamers are ('Gap of Infinity' is the Theoryland name for the place 
Egwene goes to find dreams.), but once we have a bead on a location, or 
a building, he could help narrow it down from clues within TAR. He's also 
got the wolves, and could help with tracking - which might come in more 
useful than anything they did in TAR. 
`
We discussed Tear. At no point did I ever say I was doing two different 
things on the same day or in the same hour, or at the same moment between 
two or three cities. Ever. I've set out a timeline for Jezz (accounting 
student and all-I budget my time), I know it can be frustrating for others 
but this is how my brain works.
`
The timeline for Tear is as follows:
`
`^-`7Go to Tear for no more than 2 days. 
Allow Vaelin to rest and give him things to do to gain his bearings and 
wits about him. Listen for rumors. Get rental. Leave for Caemlyn -- Done. 
`
Rumors I'm looking for are if there are Aiel or Aes Sedai in Tear. Period. 
According to the end of Book 10, Rand is still in Tear, or just outside. I 
would assume some Aiel are still around. Even old rumors of Aiel would be 
fine. Jezz gives zero fucks other than finding out about Aiel and Aes 
Sedai. She is in Tear to plan an assassination, not a picnic. The common 
room rp wasn't necessary. Sorry if you felt it was. 
`
If you need help determining the rumors I need, here's a suggestion.
Roll the dice. 
1-5: no useful information found in the 2 days in Tear. 
6-10: Only felt and/or seen Aes Sedai in Tear -or- Definitely no Aes Sedai.
11-15: Only saw Aiel occasionally -or- Absolutely no Aiel in Tear. 
16-20 Saw both Aiel and Aes Sedai -or- Definitely saw neither. 
Bam. Done. 
`
`^-`7Caemlyn. Save Sabine. - In progress
However long this takes IC time. Jezz wont focus on anything else than 
saving Sabine, now that they are in Caemlyn.
This includes trying to find Sabine's dream.
`
Here is my research on warded dreams:
` 
Warding dreams, according to this source, is based on the OP, and needs to 
be channeled. http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Ward
====
According to Moiraine, she wards her dreams each night without thinking:
`
"Aes Sedai learn to shield their dreams. I do it without thinking, when I 
sleep. Warders are given something much the same in the bonding. The 
Gaidin could not do what they must if the Shadow could steal into their 
dreams. We are all vulnerable when we sleep, and the Shadow is strong 
in the night."

Interview:
SHARON PERDUE
Did Egwene as Amyrlin happen to be watching people's dreams while Rand was 
shielded?
ROBERT JORDAN
I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Again?
SHARON PERDUE
Since Rand was shielded and couldn't form any wards on his dreams could 
Egwene have spied out that he was in trouble while in Tel'aran'rhiod?
ROBERT JORDAN
Ah. Yes, she could have. The problem is, when you've learned that 
something is impossible, you have a tendency to stop trying it. She just 
didn't try to spy during the period in question.

Extinguishing her lamps, she wove a ward to keep her dreams from affecting 
anyone else's - that could happen with those who could channel: others 
nearby could find themselves sharing your dreams - and crawled beneath her 
blankets.

I think there is a misunderstanding somewhere.

Last Thursday you told me you were excited about getting the Rescue Sabine

The leap of logic in this article which supposedly debunks "mental
health fiction" is amazing. From the fact that the alter personalities of
people with dissociative disorders are connected in some way, the authors
jump to the conclusion that such people would therefore be better 
diagnosed with borderline or bipolar disorders, as though dissociative
disorders do not exist! All diagnoses are, in a way, fiction - therapists'
or researchers' conclusions based on their experience. Dissociative 
Identity Disorder has sound evidence for its existence, plus clear theory
to explain it, unlike those other supposed disorders. Those of us who 
specialize in dissociative disorders have never argued that the different 
part-selves are separate people and should be judged separately in court. 
We regard them more as different circuits in the same brain, each circuit 
being activated separately. Severe developmental trauma prevented the 
direct connection of these circuits, resulting in relatively independent 
part-selves, each representing a particular emotional state or set of 
memories.
