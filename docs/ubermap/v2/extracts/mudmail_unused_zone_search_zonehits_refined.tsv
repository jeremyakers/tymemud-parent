The next few moments are spent going through the same questions and mild disbelief in his project, the lass appearing somewhat distracted at times, suggesting her thoughts are elsewhere.  She also continues to send glances towards the waiting room- reasonable enough for someone who is typically kept busy with those seeking aid.  When the last of her questions is answered she pauses, looking at Cam while thinking for what is a strangely long period before her original, beaming smile returns, "Very well.  I probably do not have time to do much, but I have someone who works with me who might.  Wait here and I will see."  Without much waiting for any reply she whisks off in a rustle of skirts to the other door from the hospice and is gone for a few minutes during which some sounds of conversation and creaking that might indicate someone walking are barely heard.  The door opens abruptly as Pat breezes back in, smile firmly in place and back in an apparent comfort zone, "There is still the matter of coin, but my assistant is willing to give you the names of what we use and the general purpose of each if that suits you Master?"  Her manner is quick and efficient, seeming ready to usher him into the other room on the instant.
