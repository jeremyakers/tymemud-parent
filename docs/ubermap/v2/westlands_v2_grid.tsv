# Grid size: 20 cols (gx=0..19), 15 rows (gy=0..14)
# Fill in `zone_id` as expansion decisions are made. Reuse v1-adjacent gaps when sensible.
# Suggested convention:
# - Keep existing v1 zone ids where applicable (Tar Valon / Caemlyn / Cairhien / Aringill region).
# - For immediate neighbors, reuse unused numeric gaps near the v1 blocks.
# - For far expansion, allocate new ids in a dedicated block (TBD).
