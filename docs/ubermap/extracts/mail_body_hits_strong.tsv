I was able to restore it to the version\nthat's on there now (same as the live version), but apparently\nthe daily backup system does not do anything for the BP.  I'm\nsorry!\n\nWe can do the next two stages of the project at the same time - I'm\ngoing to continue to port over cities and zones as Syrah identifies\nthe keepers.  Currently, Caemlyn and Aringill are in, as well as\nsome essential zones that the BP won't run without, and that's it.\nI'll be bringing over TV, Cairhien, and other major zones ASAP.\nSyrah, any other zones you see that're keepers, recommendations\nare helpful and would speed things up as you get time.\n\nAt the same time I'm doing this, Syrah can be overseeing the\nfirst real 'builder' phase of the project, where you guys link Caemlyn\nand Aringill into their zones, and add in the descs of the surrounding\ncountrysides.  I sent Syrah a detailed writeup on how to do all of\nthis.  It includes vnums and specific instructions on exactly what\ngoes where and what to change.  Mort builders can do any of it.\nThe descs need to be appropriate to the color coded terrain map I\nsent Syrah, and most importantly, the descs for the road between\nCaemlyn and Aringill need to be changed from their current generic\ndesc to unique road descs.  All of this is written out much better\nin the files I sent.\n\nNenae and Beonca, you guys can continue your inns and newbie\nzone - I'm very sorry about anything I lost.\n\nI should stress that this is a project that absolutely anybody can\nhandle - no real building is required anymore, since all the zones\nare designed and linked.  All it needs is people, preferrably a\ngroup of them, to go in and write better descs for each of the\nexisting rooms around the cities.  We're not going to do this for\nthe entire continent - right now, we're on Caemlyn and Aringill,\nand when I import the other major cities, we'll do them similarly.\nAny questions, feel free to beep me.  Thank Boris and Duren\nfor a hell of a job - our world isn't just bigger than other circle muds\nnow, it's a whole version ahead of them codewise. :p\n\n-Nico\n

After everybody is done rediting (trying to do this while\nsomebody is can crash the BP, so wait til you're all ready),\ntype 'olc'.\n\nThis'll bring up a list of zones that need to be saved.  This is\nseparate from the 'save zone internally?' question you answered\nwhen quitting redit, btw - you have to do this every so often too,\nelse the next time we reboot/crash everything is lost.\n\nFrom the list that gets brought up with 'olc', it'll say something\nlike '640 needs saving'.  To save zone 640, type 'redit save 640'.\nI think you can save all zones at once by typing 'OLC save', as well.\n\n-Nic\n

It's your city so you're in\ncharge of coordinating the descripting efforts of anybody you\ncan get to help - I'd ask Nenae, Phaedra and Quinlan for\nstarters - they've all worked on the ubermap - and maybe\nBethany as well (she's been bored during the day).  Here's\nwhere we're at:\n\nI constructed all of zone 90 and 91 (all numbered rooms on\nyour map) - the city should be fully working except for the\nmissing tower and the missing descs.  It's connected to\nthe bridges, which connect to the ubermap.  I also redid\nAlindaer (a half assed job but it's ok), and imported it as\nwell - the bridge to Alindaer connects to your city like it\nshould.  The other bridges just pop out at the squares on\nthe ubermap where the towns would go (see the website:)\n`^http://www.engr.umd.edu/ maeillo/index2.htm`7  and\n`^http://www.engr.umd.edu/ maeillo/TV_city2_feb_7.bmp`7\n\nPlease come up with a color scheme for the city, and use it\nin the title of the red rooms on your map.  Like `3T`#a`2r V`2a`#lo`3n`7\nor something, but pretty :p All the cities have all their gates\nmarked that way, and each city has its own color scheme.\nLemme know what it is, cuz we'll have references to it outside\nthe city, as well.  Up to you what colors you want :>\n\nIf you find any mistakes, lemme know.  I may have to do some\nadditional pfile setting for everybody to be able to edit the city,\nbut I can't remember everybody's BP names offhand so just\nlet me know or get another imm to set you.  I can do it offline\nif you send me a list of names, too.\n\nThere is one mistake that I fixed - but just so you know, the way\nit's built right now is correct, so don't change it :p On your map,\nthere are two adjacent rooms numbered 9084 - the one of the\nright is now 9011, since there is no 9011 anywhere else.  There\nis another 9085 tho, so I kept it where it was and just recycled\n9011.  It should be right.\n\nI adjusted the 'goto tv' and 'goto al' (alindaer) markers.  Alindaer\nworks exactly like caemlyn's does, and tv just pops you out at\nin the yellow squares on your map.\n\nBesides just the city itself, the river around the city also needs\nto be descripted, as do the bridges and the one-room villages\naround the city.  They can stay one room for now, but they do\nneed a desc and the name from the books.\n\nYou can do all new descs if you so desire, but you can also\npirate some of the current TV ones if you like.  Ranulf mentioned\nthe Silver Swan (never looked at it), but it'd be cool if you could\nreconstruct it as one of the inns as well, since there's a couple\npeople that RP there on the main port.  Also, start deciding how\nto use the white tower - if you want to just slap it as is in the\nmiddle of the city, or if we need to adjust it, or what.  It's your\nguild area and your call what you want to do with it.\n\nUmm.  I think that's it.  I'll be around off and on for large chunks\nof time to help, but mailing me is fastest.  Feel free to beep me\nif you guys need anything. :> Have fun, and thanks :)\n\n-Nic\n

That being said, I was looking at starting to flesh out the\nubermap a bit. Assigning names, room-types, etc. and then starting to\nadd descriptions. So far, have there been any standards set for room\nnaming conventions or descriptions, as well as room types? For instance,\nwhen coloring room names, do you want simple colors or something more\nflashy. I generally prefer one color per word and no more than one or\ntwo colors per room name, but that's just me. I've seen both as I've\nwalked around, and just wanted to know if there was an established\nstandard.\n\nAlso, as far as room types go, do we want rivers to be swimable or\nnon-swimable? Or should there be a variation of both? Has there been\nany insight in the ubermap as to which is which? Right now I could\nbuild them all one way, and just change them individually as it's decided\nwhich rooms should be which. However, are most going to be swim or no swim?\n\nI know mobprogs are probably a higher priority right now, but fleshing\nout the map seems like it will fit into my schedule a bit better. I hope\nto come on and add descriptions a few rooms at a time as I'm able. I figure\nif I can even knock out 3-5 rooms a night, in addition to adding room names\nto zones around that map, that would at least be some help.\n\nThanks,\nJames aka Allec\n
