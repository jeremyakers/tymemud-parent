Have fun on Builderport. It\nwon't affect what we do here, with a few exceptions.\n\nOn the bp, you will be restricted to the zones your working\non, call it a precaution if you like, distrust if your a cynic :p\nMort builders are now -`2paid`7- *pauses for the cheering* Rewards\nare still being worked out, but it will be in the area of a \nqp or half a qp for every room done, and doubled for excellent ones\nThis, however, may change to being based on areas done, or simple\nprojects for those fellars who are doubling up on one area,\nI haven't decided. But what it does mean, is do work, and you \ncan get loaded up with a substantial number of qps.\n\nEveryone, you MUST type:\n`1redit save zone#`7 - if you have made changes to rooms\n`1zedit save zone # `7- if you have made changes to zon files\n`1oedit save zone # `7- if you have made changes to objects\nIn short, remember to type OLC often, and if you haven't\nsaved in awhile, do so, you don't want all your work to go down\nthe drain.\n\nIf you crash the bp.. Tell me, you'll get a gremlin doll as\na reward :) Don't go about trying to though *peer*\n\nRoom grid sizes are now OLC'able.\nAllowed grid sizes range from 2x2 to 20x20, and only even\nnumbers are allowed.\nIn addition to that, I'll make standard indoors rooms 8x8 and\nstandard outdoor rooms 10x10. \nThe rooms don't have to be square, but make their size IC\nif you leave it at 0,0. Nothing can get in, and the room\nis useless.\nAlso, remember. Make -sure- you use all appropriate\nroom flags that are IC for that room, and not to use ones\nthat are not appropriate. There are tidbits of code\nthat go off these things.\n\nThe Builders Egroup is `2builders-mit@yahoogroups.com`7, If you're not on it,\nsend me a mail with your email address, and I'll add you.\n`1*Important*`7 Your name on the bp _MUST_ be different\nthan any name you would use on the live mud, if its not\ntell me immediately.\n\nAny and all room descs need to be wrapped somewhere between\n75 and 80 chars, no exceptions. This is merely for neatness\nand some form of continuity from zone to zone. So, when\ndesigning rooms, take this into consideration, especially\nwhen using color as the color charachters used don't\ncount towards the 75-80 chars.\nIf you have any questions, just hollar them my way.\nMac\n

Write the rooms for the ship itself and be sure to include the following rooms:\n      a)The room with the boarding plank...must be flagged with PLANK flag.\n      b)The room that the ship will be steered from...must be flagged HELM flag\n`7\n 02. All rooms in the ship must have the SHIP flag\n`7\n 03. Any rooms from which you should be able to see the room the ship is in should be flaged DECK\n`7\n 04. The vnums of the ship rooms should be continous..You can not use split groups of rooms like\n     200 to 215 + 230 to 240...you should use a range like 41800 to 41885 with none of the rooms in\n     that range exiting anywhere in the world outside of the ship.\n`7\n 05. Create an object of type 33 (ship)\n`7\n 06. Value 0 on the object should be set to the room number the player will go to when they enter the\n     ship.\n`7\n 07. Value 2 on the object should be set to the starting vnum of the rooms inside the ship object.\n`7\n 08. Value 3 on the object should be set to the ending vnum of the rooms inside the ship object\n`7\n 09. All other values should be left at zero.The code will manipulate them as needed.\n`7\n 10. The object should be set in the zone file for the area to load in a room that is not WATER_SWIM\n       or WATER_NOSWIM....it should however be one room away from a room with either of those sector\n       types.\n`7\n 11. There can only be one of each ship object on the mud.If you want additional ships, build them,\n     with their own unique object # and rooms inside.\n

In one day of heavy work (thanks especially to Phaedra)\n   the vast majority of the hard stuff for Caemlyn, Aringill, and zones 640,\n   639 and 638 are done.  What is left is some of the descs, so if you guys\n   could write better descs than the default ones that'd be great.  There are\n   several accompanying files to help too - it's a package containing a\n   'to-do' list .doc file, and two bitmaps.  The to-do list explains exactly\n   what we're doing, and the pictures are maps and show what each room\n   needs to be.  If you don't have a copy of it, please get Syrah, Nenae,\n   myself or any of the other builders to forward it to you, and please be\n   sure to read the top of the to-do list file.  It explains how we're descripting.\n\n   For my part, I'm looking at bringing over the next major city onto the\n   BP - it's either gonna be Tar Valon or Cairhien but they're both a mess\n   and I hate them both :p If you guys have any questions at all, don't\n   hesitate to ask me or one another.\n\n   Oh, also, if you guys are very productive I can give you the first piece\n   of new qeq - they're glowstones and they've got more code in them than\n   a xoran or beonca doll :p They're cool.\n\n   Thanks!\n   -Nic\n

I'm not entirely sure if I like 'em\n   there (and I'm debating bringing back wagons anyway), but I\n   think we need some sort of similar way to mark city gates and\n   also roads in general.  Any ideas?\n\n   Also, would you guys do me a favor and walk from Caemlyn to\n   Aringill? I love the descs everybody is doing over the whole\n   countryside, but I think we need a quick way to tell which\n   way roads go without having to read the desc.

It was thinking that\n   each city could have a color scheme like that, and we could\n   use it like this as well, for the roads.  Also, we'd highlight\n   the directions the road goes in.

4240	2005-01-08 04:04:08	Phaedra	Zone 639	4	20	4237	1105178867	Just following orders.  :)  I have completed all of Zone 639, as well as completing the Aringill city vnums on the to-do list.

I've finalized how it's going to be\n   inserted into the countryside map and have started\n   setting that up.\n\n   The plan is as follows: We're going to construct the\n   new city without actually giving it descs - basically,\n   we build it as fast as humanly possible, and then I\n   insert it into the countryside so it's all hooked up.\n   Then, Mae and whoever else she'd like to help can go\n   on and describe the rooms.\n\n   Of secondary note is the re-insertion of Alindaer.\n   Some of you might be aware that Alindaer and TV are\n   built wrong on this port - they're oriented completely\n   incorrectly for both zones, and additionally, Alindaer\n   is supposed to be south of the island and not west.\n   After looking Alindaer over, what I've decided to do is\n   to just edit the bridge of Alindaer itself - make it\n   exit in the correct direction instead of doing any\n   heavier modifications of the zone.  After I do that,\n   I'm going to insert it into the ubermap where it\n   belongs.\n\n   Anybody who's up for it can start writing new countryside\n   descs for the Tar Valon countryside or any other relevant\n   zone.  Also, if you have anything you'd particularly like\n   to be in charge of (say, you want to design a zone), that'll\n   be just fine - just let me know which.\n\n   Thanks!\n

4307	2005-01-28 12:06:28	Nicodemus	`7Update`7	4	20	4307	1106935970	   I've done much of the renovations on Alindaer so that we can hook it\n   up where it belongs, next to Maelyn's new Tar Valon.  Much of the city\n   really sucks description-wise, and I've been trying to modify it.  Firstly,\n    it was built wrong (Mikki read the map sideways), so she's got a large\n   number of the eastern rooms as being on the Erinin river, so I had\n   to remove them.  I also fixed a bunch of mislinked rooms, but I'm sure\n   there are more.  I don't consider Alindaer to be too important, so\n   mostly we're just going to connect the correct new gates to the\n   rooms on the ubermap, so that you can enter the town.  I also adjusted\n   the bridge some so that it leads in the correct direction, and as soon\n   as we're ready, I'm going to connect it to Maelyn's via the new\n   bridges.  If you guys can spare the time in a few days, it's going to take\n   several of us to do this project efficiently.\n\n   FYI, besides, this, the only other city I'm too concerned about is Cairhien,\n   which Syrah is working on.  When both of these are in, we're going to\n   start looking at porting in the ubermap.  There will be a few more zones\n   to add, of course, but for the most part these cities are the big projects\n   and we're just going to stick the other zones in quickly.\n\n   -Nico\n

Mae, my best guess is that you didn't do an OLC save,\nbut stuff like this does happen sometimes anyway for odd reasons\n(the BP is possessed, sometimes).  Typing 'yes' to the 'do you\nwish to save this room internally' question is not enough - type\nyes to that, and then periodically do a:\nredit save <zone number you're working on>\n\nFor Tar Valon, it'd be `1redit save 90`7, `1redit save 91`7, and `1redit\n`1save 92`7, I believe.  If you edit zone, object or mob files, you need\nto do a `1zedit save 90`7, etc.\n\nIf at any time you want to see which files need to be saved\nthat way, type `1olc`7.  That'll list 'em.  Be aware though that\nusing this command when another builder is in an OLC menu, like\nredit, is gonna crash the BP.  So be careful :p\n\nSo sorry about the lost work.  I thought I'd told everybody about\nthis, but apparently not.  Sorry!\n\n-Nic\n

Things may look or feel slightly different.\nThe format for world files is changing slightly between 3.0 and 3.2, which is why\nwe're making this change.  This also means that new zones from BP may not be compatible\nwith this port.  Weapons, especially, from 3.2, will not work in 3.0.  Mobs\nmay not work either.  However, rooms should be fine.\n\n-Duren\n

4567	2005-05-26 21:15:41	Nicodemus	`#F`3inishing the `#U`3bermap`7	4	20	4567	1117161249	The ubermap is nearing completion, so it's time to\nlook at what still needs to be done before we can port\nit to the main port, here.  Several of you are finishing\nup on your current zones - the work looks amazing.\nThere's simply no comparison to the new areas and the\nold ones.  That became really, really clear to me when\nI went into the old Alindaer zone and did some work on\nit so it hooked up correctly to the new Tar Valon (there\nwas a goof there that I didn't notice til last night).\nGreat Job, you guys. :>\n\nWhat's still to be done?\n\n`^*  `7Maelyn's right - we missed two of the villages\n   and bridges to Tar Valon - the south most one, and\n   the south-west one, whatever it's called.  Mae, I\n   went through and changed the color codes to the\n   guard towers and the entrances to Tar Valon - you\n   didn't need to keep the ones I'd left - they were\n   just notes to whoever was gonna be making 'em :p I\n   replaced the Tar Valon ones with the color scheme\n   you're using throughout.\n\n`^*  `7The White Tower.  I'm constructing that now,\n   but it's gonna be up to you guys to descript it.\n   Syrah's in charge of that, but if you guys could\n   help her out (see what she wants) that'd help a lot.\n   This is the last major zone to do before we go live.\n\n`^*  `7The countryside. *cracks knuckles* I'm gonna\n   do most of what's left myself, but if you guys\n   could finish your assigned countryside zones (the\n   ones around Cairhien, Tar Valon and Caemlyn), then\n   we should be good to go.\n\nAfter these descs are done, we'll have a few days to go\nthrough and look for anything major that we missed.  On\na project this large, I wouldn't be surprised in the\nslightest if there are a couple blank rooms in the middle\nof no-where or something.  Additionally, Alindaer needs\nto be glanced over again.  I've tried to fix it on several\noccasions, and frankly, it's so messed up that I get\ndisgusted and fed up with it quickly :p Most of the huge\nmistakes are fixed, but there are still many more minor\nones, and a few rooms that're blank.  I've fixed most of\nthe mislinkings (there were many).  I'll be eternally\ngrateful to anybody that can take the reins and fix some\nof the obvious stuff there.\n\nAssuming that's all done, we have two more things left:\npurging exits, and easter eggs.  I want to remove many\nof the exits into the rivers, so that you can only\ncross them at strategic points on the map.  That'll be\nneat for manuevering armies, which is already fully\ndesigned and just needs to be coded.  The easter eggs are\ngonna be part of a quest, and an incentive for people\nto explore the map.  I'm hiding a series of thoroughly\nridiculous OOC rooms to the actual map, and I'm hiding\nthem via mislinkings and teleporters, and some other\ntricks.  They're jokes, and finding one of 'em is gonna\nbe worth a lot of qps.  If you guys have any requests\nor ideas for 'em, lemme know.  There's gonna be about\none in every two countryside zones.\n\nAnywho, this is the plan.  Lets buckle down and knock\nthis thing out.  I plan on posting a 'we expect to have\nthis in by X date' note soon on proj show.  I'd like\nto actually be able to have it done by the date we\npick, if for no other reason than that may be a first. :>\n\nThanks for reading this obnoxiously long post!\n-Nic\n

Also, Nenae, if your gleefolk are game for\nmaking that inn, now's the time to build it.  We can add\nit later, certainly, but if you guys get it done in time\nit'll come in with the rest of it.\n\n-Nic\n

4694	2005-10-29 10:15:27	Nicodemus	.	4	20	4693	1130599093	Awesome - I was actually looking at how to reintegrate the BT\ninto the new ubermap recently.  I think what I was gonna do was\nsort of collect the current BT zones, plus some of the semi-maze\nof rooms to get there and make them all one zone (the current\nBT zone is almost totally empty), and stick the whole thing\nin the ubermap.  What would be better (and faster) tho is if I\nset aside the zone and a group of the asha's picked and chose\nhow they wanted to adjust it, and we can build the thing up\nthat way (so they can expand their tiny zone if they want).\nThanks, Mac\n
5183	2007-03-07 02:42:52	Valkaria	White Tower Update	4	20	5183	1173257330	Hey everyone! This is Sadren, in case anyone doesn't know who my\nalts are. I'm wondering if anyone still reads this thing. :)\n\nAnyway, I wanted to thank Nico and Duren for updating and getting\nthe work I had put in on the mud. We now have about fifteen rooms\nput in, all of which are great spots for RP.\n\nI am turning my direction away from the gardens and stables now,\nand I started work on the Library, as well as the Colonnade leading\nto the western courtyard. The Library is about 9 rooms, and I\nconnected it to the Brown Ajah halls through a skyway.\n\nI also plan on creating a hedge maze near the eastern entrance to\nthe White Tower. Anyone have any tips on how to make a really\ngood maze? :)\n\nI am trying to finish most of the outside before I start going\ninto the Tower proper. Also, Balinor, Rosabelle, and Lio have\nall taken an interest in helping out, but they need to be given\nwork zones on builder port. Balinor doesn't know OLC at all,\nand Rosabelle and Lila need a refresher course. I'd be happy\nto give it, if you want. :D\n\nAnyways, things are going well.\n\nValk/Sadren\n

There are now five\nof each slot-type (head, leg, arm, etc.) for variety. The\nequipment is tiered so that the first piece vnumerically\nfor each slot is weakest/least-colorful and the highest\ntiers have more color and often special perks like hidden\nextra descriptions or useful boons like infinite burn time\nfor a torch or expanded carrying capacity for a belt. If\nyou can think of any boons for other pieces of equipment,\nlet me know. We want players to -want- to buy the most\nexpensive EQ for a reason.\n\nThe vnums are 3516-3590. Feel free to load them and take\na look at them if you like. If you spot any errors, let\nme know (or fix them yourself :P). If anyone wants to play\naround with the Values fields to make them realistic, that\nwould be wonderful! I haven't gotten around to fixing the\nValues yet (I just put in random stuff as a guide), so any\nhelp would be appreciated.\n\nI guess that's all for now. Once I get shops put into Caemlyn\nand Tar Valon and the economy is worked out, we should start\nseeing it on the live MUD!\n\n`6~ `%M`5yrene`7\n
5702	2010-05-01 15:32:08	Anna	mobprog ideas	4	20	5702	1272746888	Some *rough* ideas for new mobprogs I've cooked up:\n\n1) gleeman - pay to play music, tell stories.  music doesn't necessarily\nhave to mean singing - could just be occasional emotes as they play an\ninstrument in a common room, as a backdrop to RP without being too\ninterfering in the RP itself.  Could also go all the way up to full\nperformances meant for players to sit down and watch/list to, such as\nsome longer stories.\n2) novice history lessons - approved lessons for WT Novices, of the\nnon-channeling variety shouldn't be too difficult.\n3) lost child 'quest' - a little bit more involved than the missing\nglasses in the Oval Plaza, a mom missing her child needs help tracking\nthem down - could even involve multiple mobs - "I last saw her at X's\nshop."  player goes and talks to X, gets another clue to help track the\nchild down and return her.\n4) help innkeeper - missing wagon/waiting on delivery for something.\n"My son was supposed to be back from town Z with some barrels of ale by\nnightfall.  I'm afraid he had trouble with the wagon or ran into\nbrigands."\nGo help him fix the wagon so he can get back.\n5) beggar - give them money or food?  money gets a thanks, food gets\ngratitude they remember later - maybe some other reward?  they give you\na piece of info, or an object they found?  maybe they flag you and\nremember you to do something unexpected for you later?\n6) illuminator - pay them to launch a fireworks display - potential for\nsignalling people across town, if somebody's smart enough to think of\nthat.  I would. :)\n7) hey, you - carry a message to somebody for me.  Somebody asks you to\ntake a message, either a note or verbal relay, to another mob in town\nfor them.  payment on delivery.\n8) innkeeper - rent a room.  Set up inns so players can rent rooms for\nprivacy for RP, or for IC purposes as a place to stay when they're\nvisiting a town.\n9) rumormonger - pay them to spread gossip.  they could be of two types:\na) wanders around and makes announcements to everybody they see, or\nb) wanders around and quietly asks players if they have heard the latest\ngossip - if they are interested, they can hear it from the mob.\n10) town drunk, or even drunks in different taverns.  say random things,\nbump into people, fall asleep, giggle, etc.\n11) vendor selling food at a street stand\n12) female singer in a tavern - pay her to sing, knows a couple different\n12) female singer in a tavern - pay her to sing, knows a couple different\nsongs\n13) messenger - pay them to carry word to somebody in the same city\n14) pigeon keeper - pay them to send messages via pigeon to somebody in\nanother city.  go into their shop in Caemlyn, pay them, write a message\nusing the editor, they send it to another pigeon keeper in another city,\nwhere the recipient can pick it up.\n15) guild-specific messengers to ICly send word to other ppl in your\nguild.  So, rather than calling somebody over guild chat, send a message\nto them.  Ex: Amyrlin Seat or a Sedai wants to summon another guild\nmember to them, they get a Novice mob to run to them with a message. In\nthe WT, Sedai & Accepted could use Novices.  Novices don't get to send\nany.\n

Perhaps we can add the zone name to the display, or something\nof the sort at least, so people can at least get a starting point\nto being wandering from.\n
1205	2003-01-05 20:32:36	Tannil	Hmmmm...	4	24	1204	1041820790	Due to the lack of a named builder list for the builders who have\nrights in a zone (eg: Standard Circle OLC numbers instead of the\nsystem where you name builders in ZEDIT) it seems that the\nbuilder's names have been placed into the zone titles.  Granted\nthis could be easily fixed by just having someone go through and\nclear the names out, but then that leaves us with the fact that\nthat the zone names don't follow any real stanard to make it easy\nto see where a zone is in the game.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean that a new field couldn't be added\nto the zones which would have a name or description to give people\nan idea of where it is.  Such as "on the Almoth Plain" or such.\n\n"A Common room (on the Almoth Plain): 2 people" or what have you.\n\nMy two bits.\n\n- T\n\n
