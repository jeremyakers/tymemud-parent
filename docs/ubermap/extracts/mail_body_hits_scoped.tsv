But a maintained hard ride, so they\naren't going -that- much faster than normal and\nare tired out.  If getting there faster weren't\nexhausting, it wouldn't be getting there faster.\nI would be normal speed cause everyone would do it.\n \nBear in mind that, with the turnaround time,\nas well as having to do active patrolling and\nalert for traps in the road, and throw in making\nsure they don't get sniped, they're not spending\nmuch time off the road.  In other words, you're\nstill limiting your rules of engagement.\nIn other words, you are still reactive.  You are\nnot making war, you're playing defensive, and it's\nnot working along a long road lined with rough trees\nand ambush points.\n \nI'm not trying to criticize.  I'm trying to help you.\nPlease listen to what I'm saying with an open mind.\n \nYou haven't had any luck finding a saw blade in\nany of the villages along the riverfront.  You\nprobably need to get one from a more urban setting.\nThere might be one in Aringill, though that doesn't\nhelp you much.\n \nBtw, your supplies are starting to run low.\nYou may wish to either work with the CotL to\nget some supplies.  Your own supply train is\nmoving slowly enough that you probably will start\nhaving men go on half rations within a few days.\nAlso, things will start to break and/or wear down.\n-Alicia\n

It is therefore, that I \nask you to personally request Lord Kolthis Traemare's presence, to take \ncommand of securing your highway.  I realize he has retired from the\nQueen's Guards, however, so had I.  It is important you ask him \npersonally, I believe he enjoys his retirement, but I require a man with \nexperience to deal with the bandits, for they are using hit and fade \ntactics, doing everything in their power to hinder, and slow, pillaging \nthe road, and felling trees across it.  I believe he is the man to deal \nwith it, for I cannot leave my post.\n.\n  With the Lord Traemare, I would also request all maps you have of the lands \nthat stretch between Caemlyn and Aringill, I believe it will be of his \nbenefit, and his charge, to examine and remove any likely points of ambush \nalong the road that he might.\n.\n  In addition, I have secured no fewer then two thousand, five hundred refugees \nfrom Aringill, and they are now in service of the Throne, operating a mill \nto both furbish barges to transport the Children of the Light, in \naccordance with our treaty, as well to construct better siege engines for \nthe siege.  It will be important that in the following supply trains, both \nadditional food, and supplies be sent to attribute for both situations.\n.\n  Further more, in addition to the presence of Lord Traemare, I would request \nthat you deploy your Aes Sedai advisor to me.

"There is a city full of Andorans, or atleast \nAndoran nobles inside that city out there that would like to see me dead.  \nAre you one of his men then?  The traitor Zalandrel?"\nLyana rubs her nose and sighs, shaking her head. The humor is gone from her \neyes and her voice. "No.  My family pulled their interests out of Aringill \nwhen the traitor starting preparing for the seige and I have even less \ninterest in him or his bid for a useless city-state than they." She tilts \nher head, looking at Than much as a dog looks at an interesting toy.\nThan frowns, and slowly the Saidin is draw into him, the tinest of strands, and \nhe smiles as the mere trickle fills him, but there is no real warmth in \nhis smile.  "Then your interest in talking seems little, be quick about \nwhy you are here, and be true with your words, if I think you are lying, \nyou will be put to the hangman."  His words are not harsh, infact, they \nare rather calm.  With the small amounts of the power now flowing through \nhim, stiffling the great urge to draw more, he watches Lyana, his ears \nstraining to listen, and he takes several steps closer to the her, his \neyes searching her face for signs of distress or flickers in her features, \nhis ears also strained.\nLyana glances at the guards and then back at Than.  She appears calm, no sweat, \nno raising pulse in her neck, no fidgeting.  "House Traemane is being \ndrawn in to support you at the highest levels, or so the rumors go.  My \ncousin is the Captain of the house guard, so I tend to listen a bit more \nto some than others.  For now, I am just looking for information - if my \nfamily should seek out other trading routes - with the seachen in the west \nand now cairhien in the east it is getting difficult." She tilts her head \nslightly and offers a smile, not a humorous one, but with a marked \nwryness. "And as someone often between here and Caemlyn - how much longer \nthe traitor's men will be rampaging on the roads and fields?"\nThan merely smiles that same emotionless smile, and he brings his emotions back \ncloser the surface, but when he does so there is a slight surge of Saidin \nwith him, and for a moment it appears he hesitates in his speaking, \nresting his hand on the desk almost casualy, but not entirely so.  \n"Guards, you may leave her here with me.  I do not yet believe her story, \nbut perhaps she was meant as a surprise, perhaps not.  There are many in \nthe city who know I do not tend to harm ladies, although older then I \nwould expect.  But fit.  I shall determine it for myself."  His eyes \nflicker toward the officer, who merely smirks ever so slightly and then \nnods his head.  "Post men around my tent, it should be no more then an \nhour, and if she is an assassin I shall consider it a release from my \nduties here, they have been stifled of late."  There is slight annoyance \nin his voice at his last comment.\nLyana arches an eyebrow again and shrugs, "It would make more sense to shoot an \narrow at you when you ride than attempt a lone attack on the camp.  \nThough, if the guard hadn't moved to relieve himself  I likely would have \ngotten close enough to at least ask for an appointment of your secretary." \nShe's amused again, but makes no move to leave the stool. "Ask as you \nwill.  My life isn't likely much more thrilling than your own."\nThan merely waits for the guards to depart, and then he turns his eyes back to \nLyana, drawing in another bit of the power, this time intentionally and he \nmakes no sway.  Nor does he simply hold it this time, he moves to place \nhimself on the other side of the desk, across from Lyana.  It is then that \nhe releases small stands of the Power, a lace of air and fire, small, too \nsmall to to cause much feeling, and infact would likely be above \nawareness.  "You wished to know of the status of Aringill?  Wouldn't \nmessangers, or scouts be more appropriate then a noblewoman?  Especially \none carrying Aiel blades, and dressed so oddly?"\nLyana shrugs slightly, "I'm a bit of a blacksheep, my lord.  No interest in \nfarming no real desire for the day to day trading life so I have always \nwandered a bit more than most." She guestures with long and delicate \nfingers sporting more callouses than even a lady-farmer would have towards \nher weapons, "My husband was Aiel and the weapons are from my...in-laws as \nwe would say."  Her nose wrinkles a bit and she rubs the back of her hand \nas it drops back into her lap, as if something she can't place has raised \nthe hairs there.\nThan purses his lips, and the

Now, there are a few closed emotes in here, but Ambar accepted them for the interest of him having absolutely no WM or fighting skills and me having WM1 at 97%:)\n\nAmbar sits on the edge of a bench by the fountain, staring intently at his sack as he digs through it. Every couple of seconds his eyes flicker upwards, watching the people moving about the Oval.\n\nAlythia grins as she approaches the bench where Ambar is seated. "Why hello there Ambar, have any new goodies for me today?" She says this from a good enough ways away, so as to not startle him. She slides onto the bench next to him, the grin still showing.\n\nAmbar jumps in his seat as he is addressed, his gaze snapping towards Alythia.  Upon recognizing her, he visibly relaxes, a smile blooming on his face. "The Light favor you, my Lady Menera," he says smoothly, incling his head in a slight bow.  "It has been too long since last we met."  His manner would not be out of place in a palace, and he seems unaware that it is out of place in the current company.  Rising as Alythia approaches, he sits again only after she sits.  "Ah, I am afraid I have nothing new, as I have had no time to replenish my wares since we last spoke."\n\nAlythia nods, "No problem, the daggers you sold me are becoming quite useful. You were right, by the way, they are perfectly balanced." Suddenly a flash of metal and a dagger appears in her hand, poised for throwing. She throws it up, the dagger flipping a couple of times, and she catches it smoothly and slides it back into its hidden sheath somewhere in her left sleeve. "So, where have you been?"\n\nAmber watches closely as Alythia flourishes the dagger, seeming slightly jealous at her ease.  When he responds, however, there is nohing but warmth in his voice, "There were some people following me, and I had to lay low for a few days.  I tricked them though...made them think I left the city, then doubled back.  They're probably still searching for me on the road to Tar Valon."  He laughs, rich and hearty, much differnt than his weak, nervous laugh of several days ago.\n\nAlythia nods, "Good for you, hopefully they'll never catch you." She smiles, but it isn't quite a full smile. "Tell me, have you had any more trouble from the man who's henchmen we killed?" She looks about the oval quickly and returns her gaze to Ambar, eyes not showing nervousness but instead determination.\n\nAmbar laughs again, "No, I'm afraid he's probably cowering in some hole somewhere.  I don't think he knew what kind of enemy he would be facing."  Ambar's gaze follow's Alythia's as she searches the plaza, but snaps back just as quick as hers.  "There will be others, though, my tormentors are relentless."  His smile, once genuine, now appears forced.\n\nAlythia grins, "I'm sure there will be more, there always is yes?" She relaxes on the bench, lying her head back and letting the sunlight wash over her. "Mmm, such a wonderful day today...tell me, would you like some lunch?  I happen to a have a little food on me, I was planning to picnic today." She smiles warmingly, head still lying on the bench back.\nAmbar nods in response to Alythia's first question, then again at her second.  He grins back as he reaches into his leather sack, rummaging for a moment before triumphantly pulling a round of cheese and a fresh-looking loaf of bread.  "My plans were much the same as yours, it seems," he replies in his easy manner.  "And I do indeed feel the stirrings of hunger.  Come, let us sup."  He laughs richly as if at some unspoken joke.\nAlythia laughs with Ambar for a moment, and doesn't even look as she reaches to her side where her pouch is. She removes a hunk of cheese, a half loaf of bread and an apple. Each of the items look fresh and delicious. Alythia finally lifts her head, at least long enough to flourish a dagger into her left hand and cut a slice of cheese and another of bread. She places the cheese on the bread and pops it into her mouth. She lays her head back once again and chews delightedly. "Mmmmm..." Is the only sound that comes from her as she enjoys the food.\nAmbar shakes his head at Alythia's ease at handling the knife.

Now, there are a few closed emotes in here, but Ambar accepted them for the interest of him having absolutely no WM or fighting skills and me having WM1 at 97%:)\n\nAmbar sits on the edge of a bench by the fountain, staring intently at his sack as he digs through it.  Every couple of seconds his eyes flicker upwards, watching the people moving about the Oval.\n\nAlythia grins as she approaches the bench where Ambar is seated. "Why hello there Ambar, have any new goodies for me today?" She says this from a good enough ways away, so as to not startle him. She slides onto the bench next to him, the grin still showing.\n\nAmbar jumps in his seat as he is addressed, his gaze snapping towards Alythia.  Upon recognizing her, he visibly relaxes, a smile blooming on his face. "The Light favor you, my Lady Menera," he says smoothly, incling his head in a slight bow.  "It has been too long since last we met."  His manner would not be out of place in a palace, and he seems unaware that it is out of place in the current company.  Rising as Alythia approaches, he sits again only after she sits.  "Ah, I am afraid I have nothing new, as I have had no time to replenish my wares since we last spoke."\n\nAlythia nods, "No problem, the daggers you sold me are becoming quite useful. You were right, by the way, they are perfectly balanced." Suddenly a flash of metal and a dagger appears in her hand, poised for throwing. She throws it up, the dagger flipping a couple of times, and she catches it smoothly and slides it back into its hidden sheath somewhere in her left sleeve. "So, where have you been?"\nAmber watches closely as Alythia flourishes the dagger, seeming slightly jealous at her ease.  When he responds, however, there is nohing but warmth in his voice, "There were some people following me, and I had to lay low for a few days.  I tricked them though...made them think I left the city, then doubled back.  They're probably still searching for me on the road to Tar Valon."  He laughs, rich and hearty, much differnt than his weak, nervous laugh of several days ago.\n\nAlythia nods, "Good for you, hopefully they'll never catch you." She smiles, but it isn't quite a full smile. "Tell me, have you had any more trouble from the man who's henchmen we killed?" She looks about the oval quickly and returns her gaze to Ambar, eyes not showing nervousness but instead determination.\n\nAmbar laughs again, "No, I'm afraid he's probably cowering in some hole somewhere.  I don't think he knew what kind of enemy he would be facing."  Ambar's gaze follow's Alythia's as she searches the plaza, but snaps back just as quick as hers.  "There will be others, though, my tormentors are relentless."  His smile, once genuine, now appears forced.\n\nAlythia grins, "I'm sure there will be more, there always is yes?" She relaxes on the bench, lying her head back and letting the sunlight wash over her. "Mmm, such a wonderful day today...tell me, would you like some lunch?  I happen to a have a little food on me, I was planning to picnic today." She smiles warmingly, head still lying on the bench back.\n\nAmbar nods in response to Alythia's first question, then again at her second.  He grins back as he reaches into his leather sack, rummaging for a moment before triumphantly pulling a round of cheese and a fresh-looking loaf of bread.  "My plans were much the same as yours, it seems," he replies in his easy manner.  "And I do indeed feel the stirrings of hunger.  Come, let us sup."  He laughs richly as if at some unspoken joke.\n\nAlythia laughs with Ambar for a moment, and doesn't even look as she reaches to her side where her pouch is. She removes a hunk of cheese, a half loaf of bread and an apple. Each of the items look fresh and delicious. Alythia finally lifts her head, at least long enough to flourish a dagger into her left hand and cut a slice of cheese and another of bread. She places the cheese on the bread and pops it into her mouth. She lays her head back once again and chews delightedly. "Mmmmm..." Is the only sound that comes from her as she enjoys the food.\n\nAmbar shakes his head at Alythia's ease at handling the knife.  "You know it took me weeks to learn to do that, and I fear I still do not match your skill."  He ruefully flicks his wrist, a dagger dropping into his hand, but with none of the artistry displayed by the woman next to him.  He cuts a large chunk from the fresh round of cheese, peels the pale wax from the bright orange cheese, and takes a small bite, swallowing before he continues.

He accompanies him to Queen Morgase and escorts him out of the Palace.\n \n- Gerhard travels with Elayne to Tar Valon to train with the Warders.\n \n- There Gerhard meets Min, Nynaeve, Egwene and many different Aes Sedai and Warders.\n \n- Liandrin tells Egwene and Nynaeve that they must accompany her to help Rand. Elayne and Min overhear and plan to come, too.\n \n- Gerhard also hears of the plot, and plans to join them.\n \n- Gerhard joins Egwene, Nynaeve, Elayne, Min and Liandrin through the Ways to Toman Head.\n \n- He escapes with Nynaeve and Elayne while Egwene and Min are captured.\n \n- Gerhard assists Nynaeve and Elayne with Egwene's escape.\n \n- Gerhard gets separated from the rest in the battle at Falme. He fights the Seanchan on the side of the heroes.\n \n- Gerhard then makes his own way back to Tar Valon, with a stolen Seanchan horse. He doesnt meet up with the rest of the heroes, or meet Rand.\n \n- Gerhard arrives in Tar Valon at around the same time as Elayne, Egwene, Nynaeve, Verin and Mat.\n \n- Gerhard is punished by his Warder mentors and admonished by Aes Sedai for running away. He keeps the truth of what happened to himself.\n- Since Gerhard arrives in Tar Valon separately from the rest, he is able to pretend that he had nothing to do with their disappearances. \n- Gerhard meets Mat. They get along well enough.\n \n- Gerhard continues training with the Warders.\n \n- Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve leave for Tear.\n \n- Gerhard demands the Amyrlin tell him where his sister and Egwene are. Min returns to the Tower and runs into Gerhard as he leaves the Amyrlins study.\n \n- For a short time, life in the Tower is uneventful for Gerhard, outside of trying to learn the location of his sister.\n \n- Gerhard leads the trainees against the Warders in the battle of the White Tower, after Siuan is stilled. He does not kill Hammer or Coulin, however: that is done by other students. He does this because he doesnt trust Siuan since he feels the old Amyrlin used his friends and he feels that Siuan has been rightfully displaced, and he trusts Elaida because he has known her for all his life.\n \n- When confronted by Leane, Siuan and Min Gerhard realizes his mistake. Min convinces him that Elayne would have supported Siuan, if she had been here. He still doesnt trust Siuan. He helps them to escape. They have convinced him that what he has done was wrong.\n \n- Gerhard leaves the Younglings and the White Tower, not wanting to stay there as long as the usurper Elaida is in power. He does not ask the Younglings to come with him: he knows that they are loyal to the Tower. He explains to another chief Youngling that he has to leave for a time, and that he is in charge until he returns. Gerhard warns the Younglings to be wary of Elaida and the other Aes Sedai. He suggests that what happened isn't just. He eventually plans to come back and free the Younglings from Elaidas grasp.\n \n- Gerhard returns to Caemlyn for a time. He isn't there long before he has a confrontation with Gaebril and finds himself exiled from his homeland. He is worried about Elayne. He also wants to find a way to remove Gaebril and whatever hold he has over his Mother. He knows that he cant do this alone.\n\n- Upon leaving Caemlyn, he rides south, with a mind to find his sister. He eventually runs into a group of Aes Sedai that has fled from the White Tower and are heading to Salidar. He joins them, hoping to find Elayne, Egwene and all the rest.\n \n- Gerhard arrives at Salidar. He assists them in building the town, and resumes his study with the Warders. There is some tension, since he led the fight to keep Siuan captive. He tells about how he eventually assisted Siuan's escape, but many don't believe it.\n \n- Min, Siuan, Leane, Gareth Bryne, Nynaeve, and Elayne all arrive, each in their own time. Gerhard is relieved to see all of them, especially Elayne and Gareth Bryne. Min, Siuan and Leane are quite surprised to see them there, since they thought he was still at the Tower. Siuan affirms Gerhard's story.\n- Gerhard is quite relieved when he hears that Gaebril has been overthrown by Rand and his crew. He is still upset, because he thinks that Gaebril killed his Mother. He is also upset because he hears that Rand is holding Caemlyn, which is not his right to do.\n- Gerhard is very suspicious when the Salidar Aes Sedai sends Min with the nine Aes Sedai going to see Rand. He offers to come with her, but she insists that he stays. Gerhard is partly glad: he wouldn't want to leave Elayne's side again, even if she was among so many Aes Sedai.\n

He accompanies him to Queen Morgase and escorts him out of the Palace.\n \n- Gerhard travels with Elayne to Tar Valon to train with the Warders.\n \n- There Gerhard meets Min, Nynaeve, Egwene and many different Aes Sedai and Warders.\n \n- Liandrin tells Egwene and Nynaeve that they must accompany her to help Rand. Elayne and Min overhear and plan to come, too.\n \n- Gerhard also hears of the plot, and plans to join them.\n \n- Gerhard joins Egwene, Nynaeve, Elayne, Min and Liandrin through the Ways to Toman Head.\n \n- He escapes with Nynaeve and Elayne while Egwene and Min are captured.\n \n- Gerhard assists Nynaeve and Elayne with Egwene's escape.\n \n- Gerhard gets separated from the rest in the battle at Falme. He fights the Seanchan on the side of the heroes.\n \n- Gerhard then makes his own way back to Tar Valon, with a stolen Seanchan horse. He doesnt meet up with the rest of the heroes, or meet Rand.\n \n- Gerhard arrives in Tar Valon at around the same time as Elayne, Egwene, Nynaeve, Verin and Mat.\n \n- Gerhard is punished by his Warder mentors and admonished by Aes Sedai for running away. He keeps the truth of what happened to himself.\n- Since Gerhard arrives in Tar Valon separately from the rest, he is able to pretend that he had nothing to do with their disappearances. \n- Gerhard meets Mat. They get along well enough.\n \n- Gerhard continues training with the Warders.\n \n- Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve leave for Tear.\n \n- Gerhard demands the Amyrlin tell him where his sister and Egwene are. Min returns to the Tower and runs into Gerhard as he leaves the Amyrlins study.\n \n- For a short time, life in the Tower is uneventful for Gerhard, outside of trying to learn the location of his sister.\n \n- Gerhard leads the trainees against the Warders in the battle of the White Tower, after Siuan is stilled. He does not kill Hammer or Coulin, however: that is done by other students. He does this because he doesnt trust Siuan since he feels the old Amyrlin used his friends and he feels that Siuan has been rightfully displaced, and he trusts Elaida because he has known her for all his life.\n \n- When confronted by Leane, Siuan and Min Gerhard realizes his mistake. Min convinces him that Elayne would have supported Siuan, if she had been here. He still doesnt trust Siuan. He helps them to escape. They have convinced him that what he has done was wrong.\n \n- Gerhard leaves the Younglings and the White Tower, not wanting to stay there as long as the usurper Elaida is in power. He does not ask the Younglings to come with him: he knows that they are loyal to the Tower. He explains to another chief Youngling that he has to leave for a time, and that he is in charge until he returns. Gerhard warns the Younglings to be wary of Elaida and the other Aes Sedai. He suggests that what happened isn't just. He eventually plans to come back and free the Younglings from Elaidas grasp.\n \n- Gerhard returns to Caemlyn for a time. He isn't there long before he has a confrontation with Gaebril and finds himself exiled from his homeland. He is worried about Elayne. He also wants to find a way to remove Gaebril and whatever hold he has over his Mother. He knows that he cant do this alone.\n\n- Upon leaving Caemlyn, he rides south, with a mind to find his sister. He eventually runs into a group of Aes Sedai that has fled from the White Tower and are heading to Salidar. He joins them, hoping to find Elayne, Egwene and all the rest.\n \n- Gerhard arrives at Salidar. He assists them in building the town, and resumes his study with the Warders. There is some tension, since he led the fight to keep Siuan captive. He tells about how he eventually assisted Siuan's escape, but many don't believe it.\n \n- Min, Siuan, Leane, Gareth Bryne, Nynaeve, and Elayne all arrive, each in their own time. Gerhard is relieved to see all of them, especially Elayne and Gareth Bryne. Min, Siuan and Leane are quite surprised to see them there, since they thought he was still at the Tower.

He is also upset because he hears that Rand is holding Caemlyn, which is not his right to do.\n- Gerhard is very suspicious when the Salidar Aes Sedai sends Min with the nine Aes Sedai going to see Rand. He offers to come with her, but she insists that he stays. Gerhard is partly glad: he wouldn't want to leave Elayne's side again, even if she was among so many Aes Sedai.\n

Whatever caused\nhim to lack color, however, also caused him to be gravely ill. He was extremely\nsusceptible to disease and even the slightest cold could easily turn into a struggle\nbetween life and death.

It was a \nclose call that his father, a strict man, killed him with his bare hands when he saw\nhis disfigured child there and then, but his wife restrained him. Instead the young\nchild was kept locked in a small room in the attic, safely away from prying, curious\neyes who might scribble the Dragon's Fang on their door. There he spent the first\nyears of his life, his only company one of his older sisters who from time to time\ntook pity on him, and the books that he was brought: his sister had passed their\ntime with teaching him his letters and numbers, and he was a quick learner.\n\nWhen Garm's mother died from consumption, however, his father showed no mercy and\nturned the young boy onto the streets. By all rights, he should have died in the \nfirst couple of days, but where his body was weak, his spirit was strong. He refused\nto die, mostly to spite his father, and lived from hand to mouth, eating what he\ncould salvage from garbage cans, managed to beg from strangers taking pity on him, or\nsteal.

He hated the paint, peeling from the walls of once\nproud buildings, he hated the stench of the alleys, he could not stand the sight of\nthe thieves and beggars plying their trade, even if he was one of them. That was why\nhe saved his coin, as much as he possibly could, so that he could one day go to \nCaemlyn, to Andor. He had heard stories of Andor, and it seemed to him a wonderful\nplace, one that he would himself want to visit. So one day, after years of living on\nthe scraps of others in one of the most unforgiving cities in the known world, the\nyoung boy who had turned into a man, left for Andor.\n\nHe would never have survived the journey if he had not, through his ability to read,\nlearned something about herbs and found a mix of common roots that could keep the\nweakness of his sick, crippled body somewhat at bay and gain back some of the\nstrength that seemed to have been robbed from him. It was little, but something. A\nprecious something that he clung to. When you have nothing and every day might very\nwell be your last, it's the small things that make the difference. The difference\nthat can mean that you live another day.\n\nThe beggar never arrived in Caemlyn, however, as he was somewhat distracted. While\nresting at a small farming village, perhaps as little as half a day's walk from the\ncity proper a door opened in the empty air, something that he would later learn was\ncalled a "gate". Through this "gate", three black-clad men stepped, announcing the\nDragon Reborn's amnesty and testing all men who were present for the ability to\nchannel the tainted male half of the One Power. As he showed the ability to learn,\nwhite skin and physical disability aside, he was taken to the so-called Black Tower,\nto learn to channel Saidin, go mad and slowly rot.\n"You can trust only yourself". If there was anything that Garm learned from his\nearly experiences in life, it was that. No man or woman, no Light or Shadow ever did\nanything for you, so if you wanted something, you would have to reach out and grab\nit for yourself.

Through this "gate", three black-clad men stepped, announcing the\nDragon Reborn's amnesty and testing all men who were present for the ability to\nchannel the tainted male half of the One Power. As he showed the ability to learn,\nwhite skin and physical disability aside, he was taken to the so-called Black Tower,\nto learn to channel Saidin, go mad and slowly rot.\n"You can trust only yourself". If there was anything that Garm learned from his\nearly experiences in life, it was that. No man or woman, no Light or Shadow ever did\nanything for you, so if you wanted something, you would have to reach out and grab\nit for yourself. It was these things that turned the Murandian beggar on to the\npath of Shadow, and if his uses were small when he was a vagrant, living on what he\ncould salvage from garbag

And finally hiring extra guards to provide security\nfor the areas where farms are introduced. Obviously financial incentives would have\nto be used:P... But I was wondering if it's doable...\nSteffan.\n

He grew up a single child into a young man and\nfound bonds with friends that he often went hunting and camping \ntogether with.  He experienced his first catch of a rabbit at\nthe age of 12 and when he got to 18 he caught himself almost\nany animal that lived in the forest but one, the wolf, always\ndeluded him.  He grew up on the out skirts of Baerlon and met\nhimself a young girl named Jenna when he was 14.  He left at\nthe age of 18 to train as a Ranger and Hunter around the area\nof Braem Wood's and Caemlyn where he resided until this day.\nWhen he turned 20 he met up with Jenna by concidence outside\nthe Lion Banner Inn where she had slept the night.  After long\nchats with her they decided to meant up again and after many\nmeetings a relationship began to emerge and they fell in love.\nIn order to build a proper life with each other they needed a\nhome.  Meldorf began building a wooden house in Braem Woods\nthat he knew so well and felt comfitable in.  After its\nconstrustion when Meldorf was still 20 but coming on 21, Jenna\ngave birth to a baby girl that they called Sarah.  Only 3 years\nlater Jenna became ill after catching an illness that no Wisdom\nwas able to cure.  For 2 weeks and 3 days she held out against\nthe illness until she couldnt anymore.  Her body was taken back\nto Baerlon where she was buried at the house of her parents.\nHe lived the rest of his life at home with his daughter Sarah,\nwatching her grow older and being the father he should be.  His\nability to catch food never left them hungry and his earnings\nfor animal skins never left them spare of money.  Now Meldorf\nis 35 and Sarah is  coming on 15, she has recently seen an Aes\nSedai in town to the dislike of Meldorf, she has chosen to go\nto Tar Valon to train to ways of Aes Sedai and learn the arts\nof the One Power.  Now Meldorf lives alone and with noone\naround he lives most of his life in and out of Inn's drinking\nand often getting into fights and bets that get out of hand and\nends him with either an injure or a small jail time sentence.\nHis wish is to be something other than what he is now.\n

Most likely, this whole thing \nwill result in my gentling or death, but what the hell, its for a good\ncause, right?\n\nHaving solidified my control over Cairhien with the Bonding of Queen\nAnalinde su Riatin, I am first going to unify the region, by force if\nnecessary, but hopefully through prosperity.  At the same time, I will\nlet Analinde continue talks with a High Lord of Tear that wishes to \nshake the Dragon's yoke.  Using this contact to make inroads into the\nmore rebellious network of High Lords, once satisfied that I have \nidentified most of them, I will enter the country enforce, and exercise\ncontrol in the form of both Cairhienin Troops, and Asha'man, while at\nthe same time, subverting the Dragon's actual control in this country.\n\nFollowing this, I will gear both Cairhien and Tear for war, and in the\nDragon's name (snicker) invade and take control of Illian and its \nCouncil.   From this point on, the plan becomes more nebulous, but\ninvolves taking Amadicia before the Seanchan do, and from there wielding\ninfluence over Murandy and Ghealdea, and perhaps eventually Altara.\nMayene is another possibility, but with the existence of Berelain, it is\nhard to disguise that in the name of the Dragon.\n\nBeyond this, Im not sure what else will be done, but please keep in mind\nthat it is not necessarily for himself that Jerod tries to accomplish \nbut to prepare the world for Tarmon Gaidon that Rand was supposed to do, \nbefore he dropped off the face of the earth.\n\nOh, and also I might cleanse Saidin.. *grin*\n\nJerod.\n

Min returns to the Tower and runs into Gerhard as he leaves the Amyrlins study.\n \n- For a short time, life in the Tower is uneventful for Gerhard, outside of trying to learn the location of his sister.\n \n- Gerhard leads the trainees against the Warders in the battle of the White Tower, after Siuan is stilled. He does not kill Hammer or Coulin, however: that is done by other students. He does this because he doesnt trust Siuan since he feels the old Amyrlin used his friends and he feels that Siuan has been rightfully displaced, and he trusts Elaida because he has known her for all his life.\n \n- When confronted by Leane, Siuan and Min Gerhard realizes his mistake. Min convinces him that Elayne would have supported Siuan, if she had been here. He still doesnt trust Siuan. He helps them to escape. They have convinced him that what he has done was wrong.\n \n- Gerhard leaves the Younglings and the White Tower, not wanting to stay there as long as the usurper Elaida is in power. He does not ask the Younglings to come with him: he knows that they are loyal to the Tower. He explains to another chief Youngling that he has to leave for a time, and that he is in charge until he returns. Gerhard warns the Younglings to be wary of Elaida and the other Aes Sedai. He suggests that what happened isn't just. He eventually plans to come back and free the Younglings from Elaidas grasp.\n \n- Gerhard returns to Caemlyn for a time. He isn't there long before he has a confrontation with Gaebril and finds himself exiled from his homeland. He is worried about Elayne. He also wants to find a way to remove Gaebril and whatever hold he has over his Mother. He knows that he cant do this alone.\n\n- Upon leaving Caemlyn, he rides south, with a mind to find his sister. He eventually runs into a group of Aes Sedai that has fled from the White Tower and are heading to Salidar. He joins them, hoping to find Elayne, Egwene and all the rest.\n \n- Gerhard arrives at Salidar. He assists them in building the town, and resumes his study with the Warders. There is some tension, since he led the fight to keep Siuan captive. He tells about how he eventually assisted Siuan's escape, but many don't believe it.\n \n- Min, Siuan, Leane, Gareth Bryne, Nynaeve, and Elayne all arrive, each in their own time. Gerhard is relieved to see all of them, especially Elayne and Gareth Bryne. Min, Siuan and Leane are quite surprised to see them there, since they thought he was still at the Tower. Siuan affirms Gerhard's story.\n- Gerhard is quite relieved when he hears that Gaebril has been overthrown by Rand and his crew. He is still upset, because he thinks that Gaebril killed his Mother. He is also upset because he hears that Rand is holding Caemlyn, which is not his right to do.\n- Gerhard is very suspicious when the Salidar Aes Sedai sends Min with the nine Aes Sedai going to see Rand. He offers to come with her, but she insists that he stays. Gerhard is partly glad: he wouldn't want to leave Elayne's side again, even if she was among so many Aes Sedai.\n

Min convinces him that Elayne would have supported Siuan, if she had been here. He still doesnt trust Siuan. He helps them to escape. They have convinced him that what he has done was wrong.\n \n- Gerhard leaves the Younglings and the White Tower, not wanting to stay there as long as the usurper Elaida is in power. He does not ask the Younglings to come with him: he knows that they are loyal to the Tower. He explains to another chief Youngling that he has to leave for a time, and that he is in charge until he returns. Gerhard warns the Younglings to be wary of Elaida and the other Aes Sedai. He suggests that what happened isn't just. He eventually plans to come back and free the Younglings from Elaidas grasp.\n \n- Gerhard returns to Caemlyn for a time. He isn't there long before he has a confrontation with Gaebril and finds himself exiled from his homeland. He is worried about Elayne. He also wants to find a way to remove Gaebril and whatever hold he has over his Mother. He knows that he cant do this alone.\n\n- Upon leaving Caemlyn, he rides south, with a mind to find his sister. He eventually runs into a group of Aes Sedai that has fled from the White Tower and are heading to Salidar. He joins them, hoping to find Elayne, Egwene and all the rest.\n \n- Gerhard arrives at Salidar. He assists them in building the town, and resumes his study with the Warders. There is some tension, since he led the fight to keep Siuan captive. He tells about how he eventually assisted Siuan's escape, but many don't believe it.\n \n- Min, Siuan, Leane, Gareth Bryne, Nynaeve, and Elayne all arrive, each in their own time. Gerhard is relieved to see all of them, especially Elayne and Gareth Bryne. Min, Siuan and Leane are quite surprised to see them there, since they thought he was still at the Tower. Siuan affirms Gerhard's story.\n- Gerhard is quite relieved when he hears that Gaebril has been overthrown by Rand and his crew. He is still upset, because he thinks that Gaebril killed his Mother. He is also upset because he hears that Rand is holding Caemlyn, which is not his right to do.\n- Gerhard is very suspicious when the Salidar Aes Sedai sends Min with the nine Aes Sedai going to see Rand. He offers to come with her, but she insists that he stays. Gerhard is partly glad: he wouldn't want to leave Elayne's side again, even if she was among so many Aes Sedai.\n

Anyways, here's the 'Legion report'.\n\nCaralain Grass:        1,000 CotL\nLocated north of Andor and west of Tar Valon, the Legion\nencamped upon the Caralain Grass is a recruiting/training\ncenter for the Children. Open plains allow them to practice\ntheir horsemanship and lancing skills without drawing the\nire of a nation for riding down their citizens. It also\nserves to reinforce either the Children camped within the\nsouthern reaches of the Braem Wood, or the Legion camped\nnear Tar Valon.\n\n          Braem Wood:  1,500 CotL\nThe second-half of the Caralain Grass Legion, it is under\nseperate command, though the soldiers of both Legions\nconsidering themselves one Legion. The Children of this\nLegion are those found within Caemlyn. Five-hundred extra\nChildren have been assigned to this Legion, the Vanguard of\nthe Rising Sun. Their presence was requested by those of the\nHand, to aid them in their task of bringing Darkfriends to\nthe Light. The reigning Inquisitor and the Lord Captain of\nthe Vanguard have as of yet to discuss arrangements for the\nHand's use of the Children.\n\nTar Valon:             1,500 CotL\nGiven the task of guarding Tar Valon, the Children filling\nthe ranks of this Legion seem those whose views concerning\nthe occupants of the White Tower are harshest, but also\nrestrained. They follow their orders, and provoke the denizens\nof the White Tower only when allowed to do so.\n\nTarabon/Almoth Plain:  1,000 CotL\nA scouting force that forms the first barrier between Amadicia\nand the Seanchan. They are scouring the lands looking for signs\nof the invaders, and bear a diplomatic envoy to open negotiations\nbetween the Children and the Seanchan.\n\nSouth of Cairhien:     750 CotL\nOf all the Legions, those located south of Cairhien seem to\nbe scouts more than soldiers. They gather information on\nmovement of troops for the Lord Captain Commander, mainly\nthe Band of the Red Hand when it is east of the Erinin, as\nwell as the number of Aiel roaming the lands. They are also\nthe most cautious of the Legions, as they stand alone, the\nRiver Erinin a barrier for reinforcements.\n\nAltara/Murandy/Illien: 750 CotL\nLocated within northern Illian, mid-section of Altara, and\nsouthern Murandy, a Legion of half-strength operates. This is\nthe standard Legion of the Children, seeking Darkfriends and\nputting them to the Question.\n\nAmadicia:              6,000 CotL - 7 Legions\nThe heart of the Children, those stationed within Amadicia are\ndivided into seven Legions. One at full strength, composed of\n2,000 of the Children's finest. Another is composed of 1,000\nChildren of the Light, their training moderate when compared to\nAmadicia's full Legion. Two other Legions are stationed within\nAmadicia, their numbers set at 750 Children, experienced soldiers\nlead by a Lord Captain seeking to familiarize themselves with\ngreater command. Three more Legions, quarter-strength, are to be\nfound within Amadicia, their numbers set at 500 Children, the\nnewest of risen Lord Captains becoming accustomed to command.\nWhile no means inexperienced, these Legions are divided to ease\nthe patrols around Amadicia, and are currently preparing a\npush in Ghealdan should the Lord Captain Commander direct the\nChildren into such a campaign.\n\nThis sets us at our 12 LCs, though it seems a little sparse.

As far as he cam remember in his youth, his parents had been moving about from town to town.  He was taken in by an elderly couple, who could not give him much, nor did they pay much attention to him.  There was never enough food on the table for the three of them, so at a young age Jayl started turning to thievery to fill the aching hole in his stomach.  His slim build allowed him easy access to tight places, where he could hide from the queen's guard after a shopkeeper sent them chasing after him.  \nHe lived with the couple until the old man's wife passed away, and he went to live with family in Baerlon,  Jayl was supposed to move with the man, but he quietly slipped away one night, rather then move to a new city.  He found that he could steal more than food, taking small trinkets from street merchants that he could sell to others, to provide him with money.  He stayed in the streets during the night, often being pushed into new homes by the Queen's guard when they found him lying in the streets at night, but he'd always manage to run away within a week at the new house.\nHe quickly fell into a gang of thieves in Caemlyn, staying in a rather large manor in the inner city that the gang ran out of.  He started doing bigger jobs within the gang, often dressing up as a noble of a minor house to gain entrance into a Lord's manor.  They made contacts within the Queen's Guards, paying officers to hold back orders on starting searches for them and knowing where the patrols would be at what times.\nThings broke up one night while they were trying to rob a merchant's house one night.  A patrol of the queen's guard that was coming back from the gates, saw the small group of thieves standing outside the merchant's house.  They ran into the house like fools, setting the queen's guard into action.  The guard caught six of the nine men who were on the job, though Jayl got away without being seen. \nHe took a room at an inn for the night,  getting out of the streets as soon as possible.  When he returned to the manor in the morning there was a group of the Guards standing outside of the manor,   every one who had been in the headquarters was thrown into the dungeon.  You could have counted the remains of the group on both hands, all of the rallying around Jayl as their leader until the others got out.   They went back to their roots, the stole golden trinkets and food, and set up in a small house where they lived. \nNow almost 27, he stills runs the small group of thieves out of the house, their numbers up to a lucky 13.  Everything they steal goes through him and is sold, leaving them all to live in a well off style.\n

A few break-ins here and there, mainly at\nsmall shops that carrying nothing of real value.\n\nToad is also the rank where a thief could branch into a 'faction', as\nit were. The Silver Fingers and Crimson Cudgels will take Toads into\ntheir own ranks, where they advance within the heirarchy of their new\n'guild'. The Silver Fingers deal with pick-pocketing and is an association\nof fledgling thieves. Chaotic structure for advancement, more by word of\nmouth and their ability to believably brag. The Crimson Cudgels are alley\nstalkers that beat people up to gain coin. Rather simple muggers with the\nsame lack of focus within the guild. Strength and the ability to induce\nfear allow for one to rise within the ranks.\n\nFootpad: These thieves are just beginning to become fully accustomed to\nthier skills, taking more risky jobs such as break-ins of fine merchants\nand the rooms of very minor foreign nobles visiting. They have begun to\nround their skills, and seem more cautious than those of lower rank.\n\nFootpad is also the base rank where those of the Andoran Road Traders and\nthe Serpent's Fangs begin to recruit. The Andoran Road Traders look for\nstealth and woodland potential, as they are the brigands that haunt the roads\nof Andor and surrounding lands. They roam the wilds, seeking prey, and are\nformed into a network, each band trading information with another. Advancement\nis based upon skills and value of the member in regards to highway-robbery, as\nwell as evasion of authorities. The Serpent's Fangs are vicious murderers, low-key\nassassins that are no better than cheap killers-for-hire. Their rank system is\nbased upon the number of kills the member has attained, as well as the risk involved\nwith each murder. Of all the weaker 'factions', those of the Serpent's Fangs\nbear a semblence to order, their ranks structured.\n\nProwler: These are the stalkers of the base ranks. They have attained a fair\nmeasure of stealth, know when to exercise discretion in action and word, and\ngenerally would rather remain alive and free, albeit poor, than imprisoned without\nhope of release, or dead. They are more secure with second-story thefts, but are\nnot skilled enough to perform a job alone. Their skills are moderate, and as such,\noften work in teams to execute a theft.\n\nThe Merchants' Word takes recruits from those known as Prowlers, as they show the\nproper discretion for their cause. The Merchants' Word is a network of charlatans,\ngathering information on merchants, merchant and noble shipments, and anything else\npertaining to great wealth. They infiltrate businesses, and when a merchant leaves\nfor a trip, operate out of the shop, selling off the goods for their own profit.\nThey also excel at forgery, as they often reroute shipments so they may gain the\ngoods without having to actually risk exposure. They are the neutral 'faction' within\nCaemlyn, acting as envoys between the 'guilds' and serving as impartial judges for\ndisputes.\n\nThief: As the rank states, this is when a thief is considered skilled enough to\ngo it alone. Most thefts can be easily exercised by the thief, goods stolen through\nthe many arts they possess. This is a standard thief, skilled in various fields and\nperhaps ready to focus upon one, to specialize in it and make a name for themselves.\n\nCat-Burglar: The top of the tier, as it were. Cat-burglars are those who exercise\ncomplete stealth in their tasks, often stealing into estates of Lords to make off with\na previously decided selection of valuables. They are those that could be considered\nelite, and those that are humble about their skills are often those that remain free\nand alive. Caution is a strong part of the Cat-burglar, and they often have forged a\ncover identity to keep unwanted attention away from their illicit activities.\n\nThis rank is also where the true Black Lions of Andor begin recruitment. Whilst all\nthieves of Caemlyn are known as Black Lions, this is the 'elite of the elite'. The\ntrue Black Lions have seperated themselves into three distinct divisions: The Ebony\nClaws of the Lion, The Crimson Eyes of the Lion, and the Silent Roar of the Lion.\n\nThe Ebony Cla

His childhood was unremarkable, the years spent in\nplay and learning. He was brought up to revere the Children of\nthe Light, but to also bear caution within his heart in regards\nto their methods, mainly those of the Hand. At the age of twelve\nhe enlisted, many considering him too young. Inexperienced in\nthe ways of warfare, this only served to drive the youth's desire\nto bear the white cloak. After a year of trials, he was accepted\nas a recruit, and for another he drilled with the Children, his\nform growing lean and agile. Though not as strong as his older\ncomrades, Dubricus showed a zeal in his attempts, an inner fire\nthe drove him onward. At the age of fourteen he was accepted into\nthe Children, a brother in arms allowed to don the white cloak,\nthe flaring sunburst born proudly over his heart. He served under\na single File Leader for the duration of five years, his duty\ntaking him from Ghealdan to Cairhien to Tear to Murandy. It\nwas in Lugard that those of his File encountered a band of thieves\nthought to be led by a darkfriend. The eleven Children raided\nthe abandoned warehouse used as a headquarters, and fell into an\nambush. Dubricus and three other Children escaped. Upon reporting\nthe incident to the Squadman he served under, the man reassigned\nhim to a small force led by an Inquisitor. They stormed the\nwarehouse and slaughtered the occupants, those unlucky enough\nto remain alive screaming in agony as they were put to the Question\nbefore the soldiers of the Light, the Inquisitor harsh in his\nministrations of cleansing as the blood of the Children stained\nthose he was to absolve. This hardened the nineteen year old soldier,\nand when he returned to their camp, he was summoned to the Squadman's\ntent. There he was raised to the rank of File Leader, given command\nover the three men he had served with as well as seven newly cloaked\nsoldiers. Two more years passed, and File Leader Ulthar led a\nvicious campaign against the thieves of Lugard and their wilderness\nbrothers. Remaining close to the city, never venturing into the\nwoods, their training as light cavalry hindering any assault into\nthe forest, Dubricus cleansed the roads of crime to an extent.\nWhen his Squadman was promoted to Bannerman, Dubricus rose as well,\ntaking command of the Files with which he had labored. Ordered\nto Tarabon, the Squadman began to work closely with the Hand,\ndiscovering the lairs of suspected Darkfriends and storming them.\nThe subsequent deaths of many 'darkfriends' drew attention to his\nskills, and he was given a position as Bannerman after only a year\nafter being raised to Squadman. He was reassigned to Amadicia\nto aid in the training of the Children: tactics, command structure,\ninformation gathering, martial disciplines. This continued for three\nyears, and Dubricus soon tired of being away from the field.\nRequesting a field command, Dubricus was approached by the Hand.\nMemories of years past were rekindled, and with a grim mindset,\nhe accepted their invititation and became an Acolyte. He studied\nunder some of the coldest Inquisitors for five years, his mind\nand soul being forged into a true Hand of the Light. Raised to\nAssistant Inquisitor, Dubricus began to learn the methods of the\nHand, not just their philosphy and mental training meant to prepare\nthem for the hardships to be endured during a Questioning. For two\nyears he labored under the harsh gaze of his mentor, Seriak Derian,\na cold-hearted malicious Inquisitor. Upon being raised to Arch\nInquisitor regarding the hunt of those darkfriends not tied to\nthe White Tower, he drew Dubricus with him. An Inquisitor dedicated\nto hunting Darkfriends, and darkfriends alone, Dubricus scoured\nthe lands of Murandy, Altara, Ghealdan, Tarabon, and even within\nAmadicia. For eleven years he stayed true to the path, either always\na step behind discovered darkfriends, or forging a new generation\nof Inquisitor within Amador. A chiseled, hardened man, Dubricus\nwas reassigned to the Vanguard of the Rising Sun, his expertise in\nregards of Darkfriends directed to aid the Children within Caemlyn.\n\n\nRumors float through the Children, and several 'suspected' darkfriends\nknown to the Hand are said to have golden eyes. Intrigued by what he\nhas learned of such, no true knowledge held on the subject, Dubricus\nintends to gather more information upon the Wolfkin. He often stays\nwithin Caemlyn for a few days before riding back to the Braem Wood\nwhere the Vanguard of the Rising Sun has set camp.

Though is father spent a lot of his time patrolling the blightborder to the north, the man did have enough time to quell the young boys hopes of following his father into the army. \n At the age of twelve when Dharl was as large as most men, his father apprenticed his son to a silversmith named Neils in Chacin, but the family lived just outside town, so the boy left to live with the man.  Though Neil had accepted he figured out that Dharl couldn't be much help, in the exact words of the man,  "He was a huge man, all brawn but no mental prowess, hands to big to be a metal worker.".   He was used to move the metal around and hammer it thin, all things that required no thinking.\nHis form growing to almost six and a half feet, Neils saw a new opportunity in the man.  He used his spare time to forge Dharl a massive sword, most men would have to use both hands to manage the thing, but Dharl could easily use it with one.  He was sent to practice with the thing behind the forge whenever he could not be useful to the silversmith.  He learnt to swing the thing with much force, and parry blows at best, never becoming graceful with the weapon, or having much speed.  His one asset was his strength, the length of the blade and the force with which he could swing were deadly.\nThe silversmith wanted not much more than that.  Ending his apprenticeship, he took the giant of a man on as a merchant guard to protect him while he traveled the lands selling his jewellery.  The man's size supposed to intimidate thieves from stealing anything from the wagon that they traveled in.  They made their way west through Saldea and Arad Doman, then back east, traveling all throughout Andor to finally come to rest for sometime in Caemlyn, where Neil is renting out a forge so that he can make more jewelry to sell and go back to the road.\nHis time in Caemlyn found him frequenting the common room, hearing a lot of the Asha'man who were patrolling the streets.  He became very interested in those men, even venturing as far as to talk to one in the Lion's Den common room one night.  They'd made arrangements for Dharl to take a trip to the farm in the near future to be tested to see if the man could harness Saidin. \nNeils left Caemlyn during the next few days, but Dharl left his services, staying behind waiting for one of the Asha'man to take him off to be tested.  He is staying in Caemlyn right now, still waiting, living off some of the jewelry he managed to take from the wagon before Neils set out again.\n

He\nrode with the other three young men, each insulting the other in good humor,\nand telling stories of their lives. This lasted only a fortnight, as Deruthias\noverslept one morning and awoke (possessions untouched - theft between those\nof the caralain was unheard of but for the rarest of cases), Deruthias started\nout on his own seeking to catch up with his lost companions. He did not follow\nthe same course as they, and as such, spent three fortnights traveling alone,\nundisturbed. He just recently arrived upon the road leading north to Tar Valon,\nand will be there in short time even with a slow pace.\n\nOOC Note: I am going to be sending this to DD (authorization of ancient nobility,\nWK (for the Forest-Lord, as I would like to have him be an WK NPC, thus I seek\ntheir approval), Nicodemus (to authorize the case and contents), and the Shadow\nas it will come into play within the Family History I intend to craft and submit.\nIf authorization does not come, then the case is ebony wood with simple steel\nhinges and lock and contains nothing within it: the Forest-Lord but a strange\nman wandering the woods with no connection to the Wolves: and Deruthias' family\nnot bearing a touch of ancient noble blood. ICly he knows nothing of the Shadow\nand his Family History with it, so that will not come into play until the role-\nplay has been fleshed out down the road if indeed the connection is authorized.\n\nLast Years of House Everin:\n\n512 NE is the year, the final tremors from the fall of Caralain\nhaving rippled across the Grass. The rolling plains of the river\nvalley (between the Ivo and Arienelle) near to the forests that\nclaimed the lands between the Mountains of Mist and Arienelle.\nA mixture between rugged forested hills and rolling, cultivated\nplains, the parcel of land was ruled over by House Everin. Nearer\nthe rugged forests than the cultivated farmlands, the center of\nthe House of Everin rose to the side of a town ringed by isolated\nvillages: their fortified manor (appearing a castle to those that\ncalled the 'frontier' home), watched over the town from a recessed\ncircle upon the hill. Three sides the hill stretched around the\nmanorhouse: seeming to paint the picture that it was both a part of\nthe town whilst appearing apart from the village. The eldest of\nHouse Everin had dwelled in the manorhouse generation after\ngeneration, seventh in line of succession and sharing blood with\nthe now deposed King. It was here that the last three of House\nEverin ended their old lives and set out to begin new ones.\nLord and Lady Everin were preparing their departure from the manor,\nservants milling through the dwelling as the men-at-arms of House\nEverin were holding a tense vigil.

It would have continued as such if not for the unnatural\nheat that begun, the weather unchanging as time progressed. The village, and\nas well as many of the others feeling the effects of the lingering heat, held\na council. It was decided over the course of a week that they should do something,\nbut no one could offer a true solution. It was a child, a young boy from a nearby\nvillage, that offered the idea of Aes Sedai. The council saw wisdom in this,\nthough a measure of distrust came with it, their homes and lands rarely seeing\nan Aes Sedai. It was decided that a select number of youths would ride to Tar\nValon, and so it came that Deruthias was selected: he had knowledge of riding,\nhe had a horse, and he was rather well-spoken. So it came to pass that Deruthias\nreturned home, preparations for his journey begun that night. His parents, his\nfather actually, drew him to the sitting room and asked a favor. He revealed\na finely crafted case, ebony wood with deep grooves that once bore gold imagery.\nAll that was left were rather odd steel hinges and a lock, one without a key.\nHis father explained that it was a family heirloom, though one none knew anything\nabout. It had become tradition that father pass it to his eldest son, and it\nhad continued as such from where the mists clouded history. The case, long and\nwide enough to bear a sword (unbeknownst to the family), seemed impervious to\ndamage, the locks unable to be picked or broken. As Deruthias had come of age,\nhis father explained, it was his by right of tradition, though it had only\nexchanged hands when a son married. With their only child departing for Tar\nValon, there was a chance that Deruthias would not return, and with such a\nrisk, the case was offered. " Take it to Tar Valon and see if the Aes Sedai\ncan tell you anything, Thias. See if you can find out what this means to our\nfamily, but let none take it from you. It is precious, and even if you do not\nfind the information, please, do not lose it. I would like to see it come to\nyour eldest son, and his in time."\n\nsecond:\nthe blood of House Everin found its way between the Ivo and Haevin.\nA small settlement lay deserted as the Lord rode into one of the many\nrolling valleys found between the Rivers Ivo and Haevin: seeming\na fair place to begin anew, the company made their way into the\nshallow bowl. The entourage made its way slowly into the basin, the\nremaining soldiers of House Everin riding ahead to secure the area.\nThe town was as it appeared, deserted, a perfect place to start\nagain. As the servants, children, Lord, Lady, child made their into\nthe town, three of the soldiers went to inspect the surrounding\narea. As wagons were unloaded and possessions organized, the Lord\nand Lady began to designate properties. The soldiers returned as\nproperty was being delivered to certain homes that would soon house\nnew owners, word brought that they had found sheep to the west.\nThe new village, as it was titled by the Lord and his household, feasted\nthat night and slept well for the first time in months. The time\npassed rather quickly after that. The Lord's son grew, playing with\nother children: the structure of the Lord's hierarchy dissolved. Months\nbegan to pass at first, a few refugees from the fall of Caralain\narriving now and then. Homes began to glow at night, more and more\nas the months turned into years. An oath had been sworn throughout\nthe remnants of House Everin: silence was to always shroud their\norigins, lest they be hunted once more. The tale had been told many\ntimes before, and it was well known to the remaining servants of\nHouse Everin that all must combat the Shadow, though sometimes\nsuch battles were fought without bloodshed. Life slowed, and from time\n\n(one more mail - so sorry - to ensure it isn't cut off again)\n

She didn't fit in, was too tomboyish for her own good. She\ndidn't look like all the other normal Salaean's, probably because she wasn't\nSaldaean, just born there. Her father was originally from the two rivers, and\nfor some reason, moved to Saldaea... he never told her why, and after 15 years\nof trying to find out, she finally gave up.\n\n   Her father loved her the best he could. Raising his only daughter without the\nmother is a trial for any man, especially concerning female things. So, he\nraised her the only way he knew how... as a boy. Sehrna got all the perks of\nlearning how to track in the forest, to shoot with a bow, some swordsmanship,\nalthough she's no expert by any means. She's much better with the bow. She\ntook to hunting and being a tracker like a pro, and she loved to make her father\nproud. He was the only person she had, she really had no friends, especially\nof the female persuasion... she didn't like dresses.\n\n   One day, while her father was teaching her the bow, the string broke and sprung\nback to whip along her temple, leaving a large gash there. The gash healed, but\nharmed the roots there and the remnant she has from her learning experience is\na white lock of hair.\n\n   She grew up quickly, wearing boys clothes, doing boys things, and quite happy\nin that respect. They lived at a cottage and she was content to wander the forest\nto track and hunt. The only time she was truly unhappy is when they went to town\nand she realized that she wasn't a normal girl, that liked dresses and pretty,\nfrilly things.\n\n   When her father died on a hunting expedition, the lord he was escorting was a \ncoward and didn't help her father when a freak accident caused him to break\nhis bow string while aiming at a charging boar. The Lord turned tail and ran\nwhile the boar ran down her father and trampled him. Sehrna was livid and her\ngrief knew no bounds. She dealt with it though, in time, but the remnant of\nan almost irrational hatred of Lords and nobility runs through her veins.\n\n   Taking her fathers beloved bow, and some scarce travelling gear, Sehrna left\nthe cottage she grew up in and went to explore the world. Now she's ended up\nin Caemlyn, a city she heard was extremely beautiful.\n\n

He found out in the end, his eyes\nhad turned gold.  Unnoticed by himself for over six weeks after\nhis meeting with the wolves.  The wolves were still sensed, and\nthere were other occasions where he saw them but ran.  His next\nmeeting, a day walk from Illian was one that he would stay.  The\nimages he got were more distinguishable, and it wasn't hard to\nnotice it was some form of communication.  He took a chance,\nallowed the wolf to close along one of the plains, empty but for\nthe two.  The wolf stopped before him a single pace away, Rynn's\nhands were shaking\nhis feet felt like they would give up, they\nfelt so weak.  He received more images from the wolves,\neventually worked out one and cut it to size, formed it into\nhuman words that said, 'Rapidfire'.  He got that more than once\non more occasions with meeting wolves.  Even wolves he never saw\nknew it, and it too became obvious as the knowledge it was\ncommunication, that those words were the name they gave him.\nHow could you explain the name Rynn in images and smells?  You\ncouldn't, the wolves all had there own names.  All there names\nwere easy enough to form into words.  Arriving at Illian, he\ntook up hunting again, but the hunting was not as good here, and\nfishing was so much more exploited that Illian was too thriving\nfor most people to make good money.  He didn't stay here long,\nbut he took a few memorys from the city, the tattoo's that laden\nhis arms.  The tattooist was some sailor, having tattoo of his\nown, and rings in so many orifices you couldn't image.  And the\nglass that same man told him.  He was a Seafolk, and had\npractically a shop stocked with so many exotic things, he had\nmore stuff than he had pierced rings.  The glass were exotic,\nand though they looked something of ready glasses, the lens were\ntinted blue.  Wearing them brought him quite a surprise.  With\nthe blue tint combined to his gold eyes, they shone green in the\nmirror.  It people were wary of him, wearing these glasses could\nstop that.  He paid the full price, and they weren't cheap,\nrisking to leave him short on his home trip.  He took\nback to Caemlyn, the same route, with more meetings with the\nwolves.  On arrival he turned twenty-one, he went back to\nhunting as before.  Life was what he considered a bore until he\nwas twenty-three and past.  Knowledge of an army had arrose, an\narmy called the Band of the Red Hand.  The interest grew now, he\nchose his next path, and left to join this 'Band'.

But I thought I'd ask, for\nthe sake of it.\n\n\nGavriela\n

I'd\nlike your thoughts on these, suggestions if any. Thinking of\nbasing the initial ranks off of Morrowind's Thieves' Guild,\nbut I'm having trouble finding the actual ranks since my cd is\nwith a friend, and he's in rehab, so I can't access that 'research'\nmaterial. But here goes:\n\nGeneral Thief Ranks:\n\nWet-Ear: Standard starting thief, wet behind the ears, unsure of\nhow to really advance without aid from their brethren.\n\nToad: A slightly experienced thief, dealt with mainly pick-pocketing\nand other minors thefts. A few break-ins here and there, mainly at\nsmall shops that carrying nothing of real value.\n\nToad is also the rank where a thief could branch into a 'faction', as\nit were. The Silver Fingers and Crimson Cudgels will take Toads into\ntheir own ranks, where they advance within the heirarchy of their new\n'guild'. The Silver Fingers deal with pick-pocketing and is an association\nof fledgling thieves. Chaotic structure for advancement, more by word of\nmouth and their ability to believably brag. The Crimson Cudgels are alley\nstalkers that beat people up to gain coin. Rather simple muggers with the\nsame lack of focus within the guild. Strength and the ability to induce\nfear allow for one to rise within the ranks.\n\nFootpad: These thieves are just beginning to become fully accustomed to\nthier skills, taking more risky jobs such as break-ins of fine merchants\nand the rooms of very minor foreign nobles visiting. They have begun to\nround their skills, and seem more cautious than those of lower rank.\n\nFootpad is also the base rank where those of the Andoran Road Traders and\nthe Serpent's Fangs begin to recruit. The Andoran Road Traders look for\nstealth and woodland potential, as they are the brigands that haunt the roads\nof Andor and surrounding lands. They roam the wilds, seeking prey, and are\nformed into a network, each band trading information with another. Advancement\nis based upon skills and value of the member in regards to highway-robbery, as\nwell as evasion of authorities. The Serpent's Fangs are vicious murderers, low-key\nassassins that are no better than cheap killers-for-hire. Their rank system is\nbased upon the number of kills the member has attained, as well as the risk involved\nwith each murder. Of all the weaker 'factions', those of the Serpent's Fangs\nbear a semblence to order, their ranks structured.\n\nProwler: These are the stalkers of the base ranks. They have attained a fair\nmeasure of stealth, know when to exercise discretion in action and word, and\ngenerally would rather remain alive and free, albeit poor, than imprisoned without\nhope of release, or dead. They are more secure with second-story thefts, but are\nnot skilled enough to perform a job alone. Their skills are moderate, and as such,\noften work in teams to execute a theft.\n\nThe Merchants' Word takes recruits from those known as Prowlers, as they show the\nproper discretion for their cause. The Merchants' Word is a network of charlatans,\ngathering information on merchants, merchant and noble shipments, and anything else\npertaining to great wealth. They infiltrate businesses, and when a merchant leaves\nfor a trip, operate out of the shop, selling off the goods for their own profit.\nThey also excel at forgery, as they often reroute shipments so they may gain the\ngoods without having to actually risk exposure. They are the neutral 'faction' within\nCaemlyn, acting as envoys between the 'guilds' and serving as impartial judges for\ndisputes.\n\nThief: As the rank states, this is when a thief is considered skilled enough to\ngo it alone. Most thefts can be easily exercised by the thief, goods stolen through\nthe many arts they possess. This is a standard thief, skilled in various fields and\nperhaps ready to focus upon one, to specialize in it and make a name for themselves.\n\nCat-Burglar: The top of the tier, as it were. Cat-burglars are those who exercise\ncomplete stealth in their tasks, often stealing into estates of Lords to make off with\na previously decided selection of valuables. They are those that could be considered\nelite, and those that are humble about their skills are often those that remain free\nand alive. Caution is a strong part of the Cat-burglar, and they often have forged a\ncover identity to keep unwanted attention away from their illicit activities.\n\nThis rank is also where the true Black Lions of Andor begin recruitment. Whilst all\nthieves of Caemlyn are known as Black Lions, this is the 'elite of the elite'.

Let\nme know if you want Aust to be an existing member of the Black Lions, I\nthink that's the current guild, or if I need to go through the whole seeker\nprocess and whatnot.\n\nIt was a stormy night twelve years past that a child was born to the Khendon family, a poor merchant and wife.  This was their first child, a strong and healthy baby boy, which brought much joy into their lives.  This joy was, unfortunately, short lived.  After only a few years, the Master Khendon began staying longer hours at his shop, and at times not coming home even when we did not travel anywhere.  This, of course, made his wife quite suspicious and arguments ensured every night that he was home.  Three long years did this stay in the life of young Aust, his father disappearing for days at a time, his mother either crying or yelling in fits of rage.  They were provided for, however, even if the distance between his parents only managed to grow with each passing day.  Then, it all came to an abrupt end.\nThe day that Aust's mother lead him away from their house was not a day unlike countless others in his short six years of life.  The sun had risen, his father had only recently arrived home from a week spent in the company of another woman and Aust's mother slowly building into the crecendo that would undoubtedly lead into yet another day long argument.  This one was different, however.  No threats were made, no insults thrown into the teeth of either party.  There was just a vast silence that stretched and was more frightening by far than the shattering of dishes, or the threats.  It was on this day that Aust's mother bundled up her little boy and changed both of their lives forever.\nAust's mother had never been on her own before, her life spent either entirely with her parents, or her husband.  She was on her own now, however, with a child to support as well.  She knew little of the outside, only that this could not be worse than what she had just left.  She was sorely mistaken.  After weeks of hunger and a child who was still fairly new to the world, she made her first life-altering mistake.  She was given a loan, however, this was not the sort of loan that one would logically take, the interest was high and the assurance of proper legality not to be seen.  The pair lived well for a month, however, that\n   was when they came for their first payment.  Aust's mother was a comely woman, still fairly young and still too innocent for her own good, and that was all these men needed to trap her.  They offered her employment, an unskilled employment that would make her the money she needed to pay them back, the money to keep her child safe from their hands.  It was that night that her life was forever changed and her nights on the streets began.\nAust knew little about what was happening, his mother's nights rarely beginning before he went to sleep.  It could not last forever, though and soon, all too soon, Aust was swept away into this world as well.  Aust's mother was broken, a mere shell of a woman and she could not bring herself to sell her body any more. The loan had long since been paid, but these were not the type of men to let something as simple as being repaid lose them the money they could earn with her out on the streets.  Aust's mother did not return that night, but it would not have mattered in the slightest anyway.  For as the men crouched in the shadows, waiting for her to pass, another was already at her home, holding the hand of a child as he walked through the front door.  Little was the same for Aust after that, no one ever knew if his mother was found, but no one cared enough to look for her.  Aust was given a story, a story that he'd been betrayed by his mother and that she had given him to these men because\n   she no longer wanted him, or had a use for him.  His child's mind would not accept it at first, however, as days stretched into weeks he could not deny the truth they told him they spoke.\nAust's was a harsh life after that, his new masters sending him to beg on street corners, beating him when he took too little from the pockets of the citizens of Caemlyn.  Once he had served these masters for a year his talents were slowly coming to be recognized.  He was a bright lad, learning much just by sitting on a street corner and listening, or talking, or by hearing the stories of the others that served these men.  His hands were quick, either could be used with enough strength and dexterity to make a pickpocket rich.  His biggest advantage of all, however, was that he could sprint like a rabbit at the drop of a hat.  His training began in his seventh year o

As far as he cam remember in his youth, his parents had been moving about from town to town.  He was taken in by an elderly couple, who could not give him much, nor did they pay much attention to him.  There was never enough food on the table for the three of them, so at a young age Jayl started turning to thievery to fill the aching hole in his stomach.  His slim build allowed him easy access to tight places, where he could hide from the queen's guard after a shopkeeper sent them chasing after him.  \nHe lived with the couple until the old man's wife passed away, and he went to live with family in Baerlon,  Jayl was supposed to move with the man, but he quietly slipped away one night, rather then move to a new city.  He found that he could steal more than food, taking small trinkets from street merchants that he could sell to others, to provide him with money.  He stayed in the streets during the night, often being pushed into new homes by the Queen's guard when they found him lying in the streets at night, but he'd always manage to run away within a week at the new house.\nHe quickly fell into a gang of thieves in Caemlyn, staying in a rather large manor in the inner city that the gang ran out of.  He started doing bigger jobs within the gang, often dressing up as a noble of a minor house to gain entrance into a Lord's manor.  They made contacts within the Queen's Guards, paying officers to hold back orders on starting searches for them and knowing where the patrols would be at what times.\nThings broke up one night while they were trying to rob a merchant's house one night.  A patrol of the queen's guard that was coming back from the gates, saw the small group of thieves standing outside the merchant's house.  They ran into the house like fools, setting the queen's guard into action.  The guard caught six of the nine men who were on the job, though Jayl got away without being seen. \nHe took a room at an inn for the night,  getting out of the streets as soon as possible.  When he returned to the manor in the morning there was a group of the Guards standing outside of the manor,   every one who had been in the headquarters was thrown into the dungeon.

We'll stick with the name Anusien.\n\nAnusien is a Hornhunter, aged 24.  His prime motivation is ego - he wanted\nto be the one to find the Horn of Valere and have his name in history.\nHis morals are questionable, in that he tends to put himself first before\nothers.  His principle goal is to be remembered, to be famous (and at\ntimes, at any cost - it is better to be remembered poorly than forgotten).\n\n<Yes, this will probably have to go to Daes, too, but I haven't done that\nyet>\nAnusien was born to two poor servants, working for one of the lesser nobles\nin Arafel.  He suffered under an abusive father and a loving but uncapable\nand unsure mother.  The lord who employed his mother and father was a slave\ndriver, causing much of the strife in the household and in the lord's\nmanor as a whole.  Anusien trained with the guards until he reached the age\nof sixteen, at which point he thought himself capable.  At that age (six\nby the Altaran custom of naming by the age he was given the twin blades he\nwears on his back), he left home.  Blaming the Blight for destroying any\nsemblance of happiness he had, he fled south to find training.  Passing\nthrough Illian he found his purpose when he hear the Cycle of the Horn of\nValere by a gleeman.  He decided that was the way he could make himself,\nAnusien Mersales, known in history.  From there, he made his way to Caemlyn\nto start finding clues about the Horn.\n\n`7The Arafellin man stands slightly above average, with a sturdy build and\nstrong arms and legs.  His skin is lightly tanned, moreso than average for\nan Arafellin.  He wears his `8dark `3brown `8hair`7 hair in two\nlong braids hanging halfway across his back, with `1red `3ribbons`7 lacing\nthrough them, and topped with one `8silver `&bell`7 on each, producing a\nfaint twinkle as he moves.  He wears a `@green `2shirt`7, laced with a simple\nkatana over the right breast, matching the two he wears at his shoulders.

We'll stick with the name Anusien.\n\nAnusien is a Hornhunter, aged 24.  His prime motivation is ego - he wanted\nto be the one to find the Horn of Valere and have his name in history.\nHis morals are questionable, in that he tends to put himself first before\nothers.  His principle goal is to be remembered, to be famous (and at\ntimes, at any cost - it is better to be remembered poorly than forgotten).\n\n<Yes, this will probably have to go to Daes, too, but I haven't done that\nyet>\nAnusien was born to two poor servants, working for one of the lesser nobles\nin Arafel.

Anusien trained with the guards until he reached the age\nof sixteen, at which point he thought himself capable.  At that age (six\nby the Altaran custom of naming by the age he was given the twin blades he\nwears on his back), he left home.  Blaming the Blight for destroying any\nsemblance of happiness he had, he fled south to find training.  Passing\nthrough Illian he found his purpose when he hear the Cycle of the Horn of\nValere by a gleeman.  He decided that was the way he could make himself,\nAnusien Mersales, known in history.  From there, he made his way to Caemlyn\nto start finding clues about the Horn.\n\n`7The Arafellin man stands slightly above average, with a sturdy build and\nstrong arms and legs.  His skin is lightly tanned, moreso than average for\nan Arafellin.  He wears his `8dark `3brown `8hair`7 hair in two\nlong braids hanging halfway across his back, with `1red `3ribbons`7 lacing\nthrough them, and topped with one `8silver `&bell`7 on each, producing a\nfaint twinkle as he moves.  He wears a `@green `2shirt`7, laced with a simple\nkatana over the right breast, matching the two he wears at his shoulders.

An Aes Sedai was in the city, and all talk was of her, and how she could help with the fight, the One Power a better weapon against the creators of the Dark One that plauged them. With her was a man, who moved with deadly precision and grace. A Gaidin, a Battle Brother, sworn to protect the Aes Sedai. That is what he wanted, to protect those that would make their fight against the Father of Lies even a touch easier. Telling his father, and his commander his idea, he was released from the Army and set out south to Tar Valon.\n\nOne could call this face handsome,  hair  the colour of a raven's feathers and laced with small, silver bells, hangs down far enough to be braided into dual braids down his back just shy of his mid back often wore over his shoulders, and his eyes are a stunning shade of haze, odd for an Arafellan.. His mouth, while tight, is often trying not to smile, almost as if he finds everything around him humorous is trying desperately not to burst out laughing. At a modest five-foot-nine, he carries himself confidently--the bells in his hair jingling all the while--and at first glance seems not to pose a threat. However, look into his eyes, and you'll see the truth--that stunning shade of hazel is like a deathtrap. His eyes are completely cold, as if the humor has been burned out of them, despite his almost-smiling lips. In short, this handsome fellow looks not to pose a threat, but stay away from those eyes, for while they don't drill into you, they certainly give you a nice chill. \n\nUpon the man's back, peaking over his shoulders are two hilts of swords. They are strapped across his back in a criss cross fashion. His clothing consists of dark woolen breaches, tucked into hard leather boots. The shirt that he wears is loose, though not billowing to allow movement without being caught on anything, yet tight enough to show the muscles in his hard body, due to years of training for the fighting on the border. All in all his clothing is rather

He lacked experience, but was carried through by a thirst for knowledge and the aid of a veteran subcommander. Engaging in numerous minor skirmishes against small enemy forces, he developed a knack for small-unit tactics in closed terrain.

His \nfather was Lethan, a third cousin of the Mistress of the four winds, the Queen of Altara.  \nHis mothers name was Joyce and upon her bodice lay a marriage knife enameled with 5 \nstones three red and two white.  Being the youngest, Raliads stone lay on the lowest \nextremity of the hilt, followed by the three red stones in which the middle one had a \nwhite setting, and then the eldest son, his older brother Enimerie.  During his young life \nhe did what most other Altaran youths would do, dueling endlessly with his elder siblings \nto become a fairly decent knife fighter himself.\nHis family would travel to the Tarasin palace often, and that is where he met a young \nnoblewomans daughter named Lila.  Raliad was but twelve when he met the girl, and \nshe was his elder by two years, but still she came to visit with the siblings Mistobar when \nthe four of them came into the city of Ebou Dar.  As time went on, the visits became \nmore exclusive, and the two sisters would venture out into the city to find boys to woo for \nthemselves leaving Enimerie and Raliad alone with Lila, and needless to say each boy \nfell head over heels for the girl.\nThe inevitable happened a few months after Raliad sixteenth birthday, when his brother \nseven years his elder, challenged him to a duel for Lilas hand in marriage.  But Raliad \ncould not bring himself to fight his own flesh and blood and refused to accept the \nchallenge of the other young man.  Lila and his brother left the scene right away, but \nRaliad wandered the city aimlessly for a few hours before he returned to the palace ready \nto leave for home again, only to find what he had been dreading for the whole time hed \nbeen wandering.  Walking into the anteroom where his mother sat alone the only thing \nthat drew the mans attention was the missing gem on the lowest point upon the hilt of \nher marriage dagger.\nQuickly he left the city and went back to the country manor before any of his family \ncould return, and left just as quickly.  If they did not want him anymore, he would not \nhang around to see them.  Taking nothing more then a purse full of coins, he set upon a \nlong drunken wandering journey.  Quickly though he realized that two thirds of his \ncoinage had been blown on alcohol and lodging over his travels and he needed to find a \nway to replenish it.  Not wanting to settle down just yet, he picked up a rough wooden \nflute and went to an inn that night offering to play it for room and board.  Halfway \nthrough his first performance, over the jeering crowd the young Lordling heard a voice \ntake up a song to bring attention off of him.  His eyes were drawn towards a patch-\nworked cloaked and his savior of the night, a simple gleeman.  Raliad slipped away to \nspend the rest of the night at the bar, and was joined afterwards by the gleeman himself.\nOffering the young boy an apprenticeship, they traveled together all over the world for \nyears.  Seven years later, when the old gleeman deemed him a suitable performer Raliad \nwas given a cloak for his own and set upon his way.  His way was drawn towards \nCaemlyn, where war and strife brought by the Caihrien refugees might prove a goldmine \nfor a simple entertainer such as himself.\n

Born and raised on his father's estate in southern Andor near the border with Murandy. Frequent border clashes between Murandy and Andor meant his childhood was spent in preparation for one day aiding his father and elder brother in the defense of Andor. \n\nAfter reaching adulthood, he spent most of his time leading a small scouting squad for his father during clashes with Murandian border troops and mercenary units. He lacked experience, but was carried through by a thirst for knowledge and the aid of a veteran subcommander. Engaging in numerous minor skirmishes against small enemy forces, he developed a knack for small-unit tactics in closed terrain. He also made a few kills, though all were at long-range... and it wasn't until much later and many hundred leagues away that he killed an opponent up-close (mainly because he was not a very good melee fighter and not ashamed to admit it.) \n\nDuring a surprise assault against the family's estate by mercenaries in the employ of a Murandian Border Lord, he found himself in an upstairs hallway, running towards the armoury to retrieve his crossbow. Rounding a corner, he came upon a mercenary about to attack his younger sister. She seemed to have every intention of standing her ground, though armed only with knives against the mercenary's sword. As he ran to her aid, he thought he was going to be too late... but he was wrong. An unseen hand grasped the mercenary and threw him with considerable force against a wall, breaking his back. At the time, it seemed that Angel had manifested the ability to channel.\n\nHis father could not leave the estate in the wake of the attack, and his elder brother Rei was required to aid in the planning of retribution against the Murandians. With ten picked men at his disposal, Kaelin was tasked with escorting his sister to Tar Valon to be presented to the White Tower. After an uneventful journey they arrived at the Shining Walls. The first Aes Sedai they met, a Red as it happened, seemed rather excited at finding a girl who could channel, and tested her there and then. Angel passed the test\nshe could channel, and was inroled into the White Tower. \n\n Returning home to his father's estate he lived and worked, knowing he'd never be the Lord of his father's lands, but still. It was about five years later that the Severash family recieved word that Angel had been tested for Accepted and failed the test resulting in the loss of her life. \n\nAnger filled Kaelin, how could those.. witches kill his sister and not care about it. His family was devistated, Kaelin took his father aside, and spoke admetnly about wanting to do something with his life. "I want to join the Children of the Light." His father nodded and gave him his blessing. Kaelin went to Amadica to train in the ways of the Light, he swiftly rose in ranks\n\nTall for and Andoran, Kaelin stands six foot in height, and weighs 190 pounds. His long hair is redish brown in colour, leaving it held back in a leather cord he hides a scar on the back of his neck. His eyes are a dark colour of brown, almost black. They are hard and intense as he peers around him. Kaelin's face is rounded, giving him a handsome feature, when conbined with his dark hair and eyes.\n

We'll just\nadd trails to connect the cities through the template zones,\nand as we get more players, we'll rewrite the descs to\nmake them better, down the road.\n\nThoughts?\n-Nico\n

She had a mostly normal life her father Darmon \nwas a farmer of one of Saldaea's famous crops the ice pepper, as well as a \nlittle bit of hunting for furs for his wife. Her mother Diedeadra was a \nseamstress, she took the few furs that Elaena's father got and made them into \nwarm clothing to help the family out as much as possible during the harsh \nwinter months. But this life was not for Elaena she never picked up on any of \nthe sewing that her mother tried so hard to teach her. Instead she spent most \nof her life following her dad around, and trying hard to pick up every bit \nabout hunting that she could, from the time she was eight till she was about \nthirteen she wanted to be a hunter and sell furs for a living, of course her \nbeing an only child, and her father who had always wanted to ahve a boy allowed \nthis, but only when her mother could not discover what he was teaching thier \ndaughter. But all that changed once she was able to have some freedom, and she \nbegan to see the world, the local inn mostly, she liked to go there and talk to \nthe local hunters. But one day as young minds are feeble, she found a profession \nthat she truly wanted she wanted to be a Gleemen. She watched how the Gleemen \nattracted so much attention, and drew large crowds, so she began to observe the \nman's actions as much as she could. After the Gleemen left town Elaena began to \npursue this talent as much as she could, she began to learn how to juggle the \nknives that her father gave her, and then also picked up on playing the harp, \nand she began to play for the local inns. Her family soon found out what she was \ndoing, and both mother and father were disappointed in her for even thoguh they \nheld different views on how to raise her and what she should become, they both \nagreed that the life of a Gleemen was not a life that they wanted for thier child. \nElaena, angry with her parents, and wishing to find a gleemen to apprentice under \nto further master her skills set out to find a real Gleeman so that she could \napprentice and become a full Gleeman. \n   \nOn her journey she spent a lot of nights camped out in the woods, and one night \nwhen it was time for her to put up camp she saw a camp fire already made up. \nIntroducing herself to her strange company she told her life story to the man \nand woman in the campsite, and then they told theirs. Apparently they were both \nWolfkin, and lived in the wilderness with wolves, Elaena thought this a very odd \nthing, but kept listening, because perhaps someday she could tell a story about \nit. It is that night that she was told that she could speak to the wolves herself, \nshe of course didn't believe them, but upon thier instruction however doubtful she \nwas about it, she did make an atempt to 'feel' for the wolves as they called it. \nThat is when she found herself able to 'feel' a wolf at the edge of the camp that \nshe had not seen there before, this wolf shortly after her discovery, entered the \ncamp, to share dinner with the strange couple. Freaked out by the encounter Elaena \nfled from the camp just as soon as she could, despite the couples warnings that \nshe should stay with them, to learn more about her 'gift'. The wolves aptly named \nher RushingWind for this, for her music that she played upon her harp reminded them \nof the music the wind made when it flowed through the woods, and her quick escape\nfrom them only added to this new name they had for her. Still in pursuit of her \ndream she came to Caemlyn, but by time she arrived at Caemlyn her eyes were already \nstarting to change, and despite the strange couples warnings about her soon to be \nchanging eye color Elaena, has discovered that in the cities there are no wolves to \ntorture her thoughts, so now she hides in Caemlyn away from the wolves where she can \npersue her dreams.\n

She had a mostly normal life her father Darmon \nwas a farmer of one of Saldaea's famous crops the ice pepper, as well as a \nlittle bit of hunting for furs for his wife. Her mother Diedeadra was a \nseamstress, she took the few furs that Elaena's father got and made them into \nwarm clothing to help the family out as much as possible during the harsh \nwinter months. But this life was not for Elaena she never picked up on any of \nthe sewing that her mother tried so hard to teach her. Instead she spent most \nof her life following her dad around, and trying hard to pick up every bit \nabout hunting that she could, from the time she was eight till she was about \nthirteen she wanted to be a hunter and sell furs for a living, of course her \nbeing an only child, and her father who had always wanted to ahve a boy allowed \nthis, but only when her mother could not discover what he was teaching thier \ndaughter. But all that changed once she was able to have some freedom, and she \nbegan to see the world, the local inn mostly, she liked to go there and talk to \nthe local hunters. But one day as young minds are feeble, she found a profession \nthat she truly wanted she wanted to be a Gleemen. She watched how the Gleemen \nattracted so much attention, and drew large crowds, so she began to observe the \nman's actions as much as she could. After the Gleemen left town Elaena began to \npursue this talent as much as she could, she began to learn how to juggle the \nknives that her father gave her, and then also picked up on playing the harp, \nand she began to play for the local inns. Her family soon found out what she was \ndoing, and both mother and father were disappointed in her for even thoguh they \nheld different views on how to raise her and what she should become, they both \nagreed that the life of a Gleemen was not a life that they wanted for thier child. \nElaena, angry with her parents, and wishing to find a gleemen to apprentice under \nto further master her skills set out to find a real Gleeman so that she could \napprentice and become a full Gleeman. \n   \nOn her journey she spent a lot of nights camped out in the woods, and one night \nwhen it was time for her to put up camp she saw a camp fire already made up. \nIntroducing herself to her strange company she told her life story to the man \nand woman in the campsite, and then they told theirs. Apparently they were both \nWolfkin, and lived in the wilderness with wolves, Elaena thought this a very odd \nthing, but kept listening, because perhaps someday she could tell a story about \nit. It is that night that she was told that she could speak to the wolves herself, \nshe of course didn't believe them, but upon thier instruction however doubtful she \nwas about it, she did make an atempt to 'feel' for the wolves as they called it. \nThat is when she found herself able to 'feel' a wolf at the edge of the camp that \nshe had not seen there before, this wolf shortly after her discovery, entered the \ncamp, to share dinner with the strange couple.

Born and raised on his father's estate in southern Andor near the border with Murandy. Frequent border clashes between Murandy and Andor meant his childhood was spent in preparation for one day aiding his father and elder brother in the defense of Andor. \n \nAfter reaching adulthood, he spent most of his time leading a small scouting squad for his father during clashes with Murandian border troops and mercenary units. He lacked experience, but was carried through by a thirst for knowledge and the aid of a veteran subcommander. Engaging in numerous minor skirmishes against small enemy forces, he developed a knack for small-unit tactics in closed terrain. He also made a few kills, though all were at long-range... and it wasn't until much later and many hundred leagues away that he killed an opponent up-close (mainly because he was not a very good melee fighter and not ashamed to admit it.) \n \nDuring a surprise assault against the family's estate by mercenaries in the employ of a Murandian Border Lord, he found himself in an upstairs hallway, running towards the armoury to retrieve his crossbow. Rounding a corner, he came upon a mercenary about to attack his younger sister. She seemed to have every intention of standing her ground, though armed only with knives against the mercenary's sword. As he ran to her aid, he thought he was going to be too late... but he was wrong. An unseen hand grasped the mercenary and threw him with considerable force against a wall, breaking his back. At the time, it seemed that Angel had manifested the ability to channel.\n \nHis father could not leave the estate in the wake of the attack, and his elder brother Rei was required to aid in the planning of retribution against the Murandians. With ten picked men at his disposal, Kaelin was tasked with escorting his sister to Tar Valon to be presented to the White Tower. After an uneventful journey they arrived at the Shining Walls. The first Aes Sedai they met, a Red as it happened, seemed rather excited at finding a girl who could channel, and tested her there and then. Angel passed the test\nshe could channel, and was inroled into the White Tower. \n \n Returning home to his father's estate he lived and worked, knowing he'd never be the Lord of his father's lands, but still. It was about five years later that the Severash family recieved word that Angel had been tested for Accepted and failed the test resulting in the loss of her life. \n \nAnger filled Kaelin, how could those.. witches kill his sister and not care about it. His family was devistated, Kaelin took his father aside, and spoke admetnly about wanting to do something with his life. "I want to join the Children of the Light." His father nodded and gave him his blessing. Kaelin went to Amadica to train in the ways of the Light, he swiftly rose in ranks\n \nTall for and Andoran, Kaelin stands six foot in height, and weighs 190 pounds. His long hair is redish brown in colour, leaving it held back in a leather cord he hides a scar on the back of his neck. His eyes are a dark colour of brown, almost black. They are hard and intense as he peers around him. Kaelin's face is rounded, giving him a handsome feature, when conbined with his dark hair and eyes.\n

Much of the information (such as the trip to the Tower) happened to this character when I played her three+ years ago.  I haven't included any details such as character names or specific actions from that time, because I realize we're in a new timeline, but I was hoping to keep the basics of my experience with this character now, and just add ten years to her life.  If there's anything that needs to change, please let me know.  (Description will come in next email)\nPhaedra Ashaya was born five and a score years ago in the port town of Aringill.  Her mother was a young commoner named Arrila and her father a young gleeman named Jens.  Jens was by no means near enough the age of retirement to think of it seriously, but when his bride found out they were expecting, he did exactly that, leaving the life of the wandering vagabond behind him.  Having come from a fairly wealthy family, Jens had enough saved to buy a small house and raise his young family in relative comfort.\nShortly after the new arrival, Arrila took ill and before the baby could walk, she had died of consumption.  Jens, a young widower with an infant girl, did the only thing his grieving heart would allow: he took up his old profession, hiring a wetnurse to accompany him on his travels as he took his baby girl everywhere he went.\nPhaedra was from minute one Jens' pride and joy: a living memorium to his lost wife.  He raised her well, dismissing the nanny when the girl was old enough to talk.  Her young life was filled with colors and education in reading, writing, entertainment, culture, and love.  Jens raised her to be a living monument to happiness, vibrance, and hope.\nHer violet eyes came neither from Jens, whose eyes were crystal blue, or her mother, whose eyes here a light hazel. Jens told her once that her eyes turned violet after her mother passed, because the Wheel spun out the royalty in her blood and infused it in Phaedra's eyes.  Phaedra has no memory of her mother other than the well-crafted stories told by her father, but she carries her mother in her heart.  Around her neck, Phaedra wears a small locket which contains a single strand of her mother's own long yellow hair.\nWhen she was 15, Jens brought her to Caemlyn, where he hoped she would be able to strike out on her own in whatever capacity she felt worthwhile.  After a brief stint at the White Tower in the hopes of training there to become Aes Sedai, but finding no talent for the One Power, she returned to Caemlyn.\nThere she decided to follow in her beloved father's footsteps and decided to become a gleeman.  One who could make her mother proud.  She let her already long and shining golden hair grow out to past her waist in remembrance of her mother's own.  She studied with other traveling performers and bards in and around Caemlyn for a little over a year.\nHer studies were slowed temporarily when she met and older gentleman and began a clendestine relationship with him, only to have it end suddenly with his disappearance.  One day he was with her and lavishing her with gifts, love, and promises, and the next, he was simply gone.\nThough she despaired for some short time, pessimism is simply not in Phaedra's nature, so she bounced back from that heartache and renewed her studies with vigor.  She left Caemlyn and traveled the world, sometimes with other gleemen or travelers, sometimes alone.  After the end of her first, and only, romantic relationship almost ten years ago, Phaedra left both romance and the thought of becoming a gleeman behind.  She has been traveling and performing, learning arts from whomever would teach her, studying all forms of music and dance, as well as typical street performances like juggling and story-telling.\nShe has met Tinkers, Aiel, Dragonsworn, Whitecloaks, Aes Sedai, Warders, soldiers, blacksmiths, weavers, mayors, and refugees.  Her life has been a rich tapestry of swirling color and sound.\nBut the years are beginning to show now and she wishes to pick up where she left off ten years ago.  The dream to follow in her father's footsteps is rekindled.  The last place she knew to look for him was in Caemlyn, so to Caemlyn she has returned.  Whether she will find him, she knows not, but one thing is sure: she will wear the patched cloak like her father, and her mother's light will shine down on her with pride.\n\nHope that works.  Description to follow.  Thanks!!!\n

His older brother, Daevid, was to inherit the family lands and duties, but took sick shortly before Rowen's parents died, and succumbed to a fever.  So, at age twenty-two, Rowen inherited land and title, though he was ill prepared for it.  His family's estate is in southern Andor nestled by the Cary River near the Hills of Kintara.  Most of the residents grow wheat and raise sheep, but the lush land does allow for small but valuable grape vineyards raised on the estate.\n\nMore used to riding and overseeing the vineyards and fields, Rowen was unprepared to be thrust into business and politics, but did his best.  The year after his parents' death he traveled to Mayene to seek favorable markets for his grain and wines.  Instead, he found a wife.  He fell deeply in love with Embeth sur Arandaille, youngest daughter of Belial sur Arandaille - one of the Second of Mayene.

Though married for over ten years now, the couple remains childless, but it doesn't seem to bother them overmuch.  Rowen spends most of his days handling disputes amongst the commoners and tending his vineyards and horses.  He is a country lord to the marrow, and though he is educated in courtly manners, he prefers to spend his time amongst the commoners that live on his holdings.  The peasants admire him for both his fairness and his good spirit.

4875	2005-01-03 03:01:03	1805	1805	WM forms form (hah!)	\n`7--] `6A Moment in Tyme MUD Mail System`7 [--\n`7Date`6:`7 Mon Jan  3 01:01:04 2005\n`7From`6:`7 Nicodemus\n`7Subj`6:`7 WM forms form (hah!)\n`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7\n`7CC`6: `7Eradin Beonca \n\nEach form can have as many as four tiers, where the skill level\nis directly equivalent to the WM setting (if there is one) and\neach 100 is equivalent to the WM lvl.  The breakdown is:\n\nTier 0 has no WM associated with it and is given by skill levels\nof 1 - 100.\nTier 1 is WM1/1 - WM1/100, and has a skill level of 101-200.\nTier 2 is WM2/1 - WM2/100, and has a skill level of 201-300.\nTier 3 is WM3/1 - WM3/100, and has a skill level of 301-400.\nTier 4 is WM4/1 - WM4/100, and has a skill level of great than\n400.\n\nI don't think we need to have a separate desc for tier 4 forms.\nWhen a form reaches that level, it just uses tier 4 stats with\nthe same text desc.\n\nTier 0 is for totally inept or comical forms - like flailing\nyour arms, shreaking, etc - stuff somebody might realistically do\nif they'd never held a weapon and were suddenly faced with a well\ntrained foe.\n\nTiers 1 - 4 pertain to WM lvls.\n\nEach tier needs different text versions depending on the player's\nAggressiveness and follow-through.\nAn attack tier should include:\n"normal" initial text\n"aggressive" initial text\n"reckless" initial text\nAn example might be: Ru'an looses a haphazard horizontal slash\nfrom his `3right`7 to `3left`7 aimed at <victim>'s <bodypart>.\nWhatever orientation you guys use now is fine - with respect to\nvictim or attacker, I don't care.  Also:\nundefended "practice" hit text\nundefended "normal" hit text\nundefended "extreme" hit text\nThis is the end of the form, where it explains what happened if\nthe victim failed to defend.  Like: Ru'an pivots smoothly with\nleft arm extended, raking his weapon across <victim's> <bodypart>\nwith enormous followthrough! Or something.  The next line would be\na standard message from the code saying "Ru'an deals Jake a substantial\nwound" or something similar.\nThere are also form-specific critical failures.  For attacks, they\nare:\n"fall down" text - character fouls up so bad he lands on his arse.\n"stumble/recover" text - character botches form but still executes (codely,\nthis lowers the tier by 1 for that turn)\n"loss of weapon" text - player looses grip on weapon, total failure\nto attack\n"counter text" - player gives an opportunity for opponent to slip in\nan attack.

After everybody is done rediting (trying to do this while\nsomebody is can crash the BP, so wait til you're all ready),\ntype 'olc'.\n\nThis'll bring up a list of zones that need to be saved.  This is\nseparate from the 'save zone internally?' question you answered\nwhen quitting redit, btw - you have to do this every so often too,\nelse the next time we reboot/crash everything is lost.\n\nFrom the list that gets brought up with 'olc', it'll say something\nlike '640 needs saving'.  To save zone 640, type 'redit save 640'.\nI think you can save all zones at once by typing 'OLC save', as well.\n\n-Nic\n

His father worked at a horse breeder's while his mother\ntended the homestead.  From as soon as he was able, Vitor was\nworking alongside his father to help provide for his mother and\none sister.  Vitor was an intelligent child who early on expressed\na desire to learn and a gentle disposition, but his family could \nnot afford to provide him with more than a makeshift education.\nHe taught himself and his sister Aino to read from his father's\nsmall collection of books.  He found that he had little interest\nin fantastic stories, however, and only liked books about the\nnatural world or other lands.  His favorite was a book depicting\nthe various fish that could be found in the ocean of Tear, with\ncolored illustrations that he found at least as interesting as the\ntext.  When Aino was seventeen, she began suffering from\nmysterious but violent bouts of illness.  She shook from fever and\nchills intermittently for a few hours or a day, then was fine.\nThis lasted for several months, by the end of which his parents\nwere exchanging worried looks over Aino's head quite frequently.\nThe village wise woman came and spoke with Vitor's parents.  She\nhad seen such things before, and advised something the Belfours\nwere loathe to do - sending Aino north to Tar Valon, because she\ncould channel the One Power.  Not that the wise woman could, of\ncourse, but she had seen the same pattern in several children\nbefore.\n   The family was too poor to pay for an escort to take Aino \nnorth, so it fell to Vitor to accompany her.  Their journey was \nslow, and not easy, and often they hadn't the money to pay for a\nsquare meal.  Vitor, however, had always trusted his luck, it saw\nthem through Far Madding, Caemlyn, and Tar Valon until Aino's name\nwas entered in the novice book.  Not wanting to linger around Aes\nSedai any longer than he must, Vitor bode his sister farewell and \nbegan the journey home.  It was winter by then, and snow covered\nthe land around Tar Valon.  He made camp one day in a large, open \npatch of snow surrounded by trees.  Little did he know it was a\nfrozen lake, the ice covered with a layer of new snowfall.  A\nshort time after lighting his fire, he heard the ice start to\ncrackle.  He scrambled for the treeline, but it was already too\nlate.  The ice gave way, plunging him into freezing water and\ndriving the breath from his lungs with a shock.  He flailed \nupwards, and met a hard cold surface.  He had lost track of where\nhe was, under the ice.  Looking up he saw nothing but white in all\ndirections.  Panic set in, and desperation born of the knowledge\nof certain death.

His father worked at a horse breeder's while his mother\ntended the homestead.

He found that he had little interest\nin fantastic stories, however, and only liked books about the\nnatural world or other lands.  His favorite was a book depicting\nthe various fish that could be found in the ocean of Tear, with\ncolored illustrations that he found at least as interesting as the\ntext.  When Aino was seventeen, she began suffering from\nmysterious but violent bouts of illness.

Vitor, however, had always trusted his luck, it saw\nthem through Far Madding, Caemlyn, and Tar Valon until Aino's name\nwas entered in the novice book.  Not wanting to linger around Aes\nSedai any longer than he must, Vitor bode his sister farewell and \nbegan the journey home.  It was winter by then, and snow covered\nthe land around Tar Valon.

His father was a distant older man, but his mother a kind young woman, married to his father through an arrangement made by her peasant parents.  His father abused his young wife horribly, cursing her for a witch each time his paltry crop failed to grow or their only child failed to grow strongly enough.\n\nWhen Tristan was seven, his mother began a love affair with one of the two young stablehands that worked their farm.  She hungered for the love of a man who treated her well, and the two plotted to murder Tristan's father.  Unfortunately, their plans came for naught when the older man discovered them amking love when he returned early from a trip into Four Kings.\n\nHe murdered them both, slitting the farmhand's throat and beating his wife to death.  Tristan ran to the sound of his mother screaming as she was bludgeoned to death and cried as he watched her pass from this world at the hands of his maniac father.  In a rage, he turned on his young son, whipping him with his belt buckle.  The thrashing was so intense that at one point, the spike on the buckle sliced open the boy's left eye, leaving a long, thin scar from his forehead to the bottom of his cheek.  Not wanting anyone to know how it happened, Tristan's father left him to heal without assistance.  For half a year he was blind.  when he had blessedly regained his sight, his left eye had been drained of the brilliant hazel color of his right, and had turned a cold, pale blue.\n\nAfter that, his father trusted no one, forbade Tristan to mention his mother, and began drinking excessively.  For the next ten years, Tristan worked hard at the farm and rarely spoke.

His father was a distant older man, but his mother a kind young woman, married to his father through an arrangement made by her peasant parents.  His father abused his young wife horribly, cursing her for a witch each time his paltry crop failed to grow or their only child failed to grow strongly enough.\n\nWhen Tristan was seven, his mother began a love affair with one of the two young stablehands that worked their farm.  She hungered for the love of a man who treated her well, and the two plotted to murder Tristan's father.  Unfortunately, their plans came for naught when the older man discovered them amking love when he returned early from a trip into Four Kings.\n\nHe murdered them both, slitting the farmhand's throat and beating his wife to death.  Tristan ran to the sound of his mother screaming as she was bludgeoned to death and cried as he watched her pass from this world at the hands of his maniac father.  In a rage, he turned on his young son, whipping him with his belt buckle.  The thrashing was so intense that at one point, the spike on the buckle sliced open the boy's left eye, leaving a long, thin scar from his forehead to the bottom of his cheek.  Not wanting anyone to know how it happened, Tristan's father left him to heal without assistance.  For half a year he was blind.  when he had blessedly regained his sight, his left eye had been drained of the brilliant hazel color of his right, and had turned a cold, pale blue.\n\nAfter that, his father trusted no one, forbade Tristan to mention his mother, and began drinking excessively.  For the next ten years, Tristan worked hard at the farm and rarely spoke.  When his father's drinking got too out of hand, he would beat the boy senseless with anything he could lay his gnarled hands on.  As Tristan grew to manhood, the beatings grew more frequent and more brutal.  The boy learned quickly never to speak, and over time he forgot his mother's name.  His father, when he spoke to him, he simply called 'Sir'.\n\nFinally about three months ago, Tristan, now grown to be a slightly emaciated but well-built young man driven half-mad with rage, anger, and ressentment, exacted his final revenge.

The Bowl has been found and brought back\nto Caemlyn so now all that has to be done is RP of Elayne figuring out a way to work\nthe Bowl, then the actual working of the Bowl.\n  \nPlant Beast/Age of Legends\nI haven't offically handed it out, but both Rand and Elayne have been ICly looking\ninto it. Elayne has been speaking to the Wise Ones about getting thier aide in channeling\nto get rid of this beast. Speak to her find out what she is planning. Rand has been\ntold by the Wise Ones about this Plant beast, so he wants to go and see this site,\nso he'll probably want to be involved with it too. Shai'tan has the details on the\nPlant Beast, but I'm mailing Bethany the specifics that should be known about this Plant\nso that she can pass out the job to someone to finish for her. Very likely Shai'tan could\nvery easily finish running this quest, she saw the first one and helped with it, so she\nhas a very good idea of what is going on with it. It mainly just needs finished, and\nwhatever we wish to reward the people who investigate the ruins with needs to be\nhanded out. *glow stones etc etc btw we owe two working and two broke glow stones to the\nBlack Tower* *I'm leaving a note here that whoever runs this quest, that Kaevan *part \nof the Black Lions* was ICly asked to get a power wrought dagger, so if he joins in the\nquest can I request that someone give him a chance to obtain one of these.*\n  \nBlack Lions\nThis I handed out to Nenae since I originally got the idea from her, plus she is also\nthe GL of the Thieves Guild, with this quest I hoped to get more thieves as well. The \nidea is that the black Lions which are viewed sort of like the mafia, have been paying \noff the Queen's Guard to look the other way with all of the crimes that they pull. Now \nthe Black Lions are usually part of the larger deals though, hired out assassins, \nkidnappings, if they steal it is usually a large job, like stealing from a nobles house.\nAnyway the line of RP that I have been doing lately is that the Black Lions have been\noffering out protection to local merchants and innkeeps, which means that more and more\nmerchants are winding up dead as they can't pay the demands of the Black Lions to protect\nthier businesses. Now with this line of RP it has gotten Kheldon's attention so he has\nbeen seeking out information on this very feared and hush hush group. So likely there will\nbe atempts on his life etc etc, Kheldon has now gotten Elayne involved who has given\nhim an IC force to aide him in rooting out these Black Lions members.\n  \nWise One stuff\nBasically I have a hundred and one ideas here...but the most important that I am\nworried about it getting Amra her lessons getting her rings and spire RP as well\nas her Dreaming lessons ICly and OoCly teaching her skills. I want to see her raised\nsoon. As well I want to see Mandi have her lessons RPed out too. She has become a Wise\nOne Apprentice, and is to be sister bonded to Janae, with Anastasia as thier mother.\nMandi also needs to be taken though the rings. Mandi is allowed two days for Rhuidean\nRand has agreed to gate whoever takes her back and forth, and she is allowed to be taught\nfrom whenever we summon her, till Noon, only thing is that she has to be -in- the Black\ntower by Noon. The Wise ones ahve agreed to -try- and teach her how to channel without\nhand gestures, very hard thing to do, so she must relearn how to channel everything, it\nwill take much much work for her to learn this ability, in return Mandi ahs agreed to \nteach the Wise Ones things she learned in the Tower. \n  \nEgwene Stuff\nUgh I could go on forever with this. Bascially Caemlyn and Cairhien are pretty\nfirmly behind Egwene. The Black Tower *Kinje* has met with Egwene to discuss\nan alliance, Egwene thinks its a good idea, thoguh she left Kinje with no promises\nas she did not like Gavriela Sedai one bit, especialy when the woman outright tried\nto tell her what to do. kinje has expressed that for Egwene to get aide from the Black\nTower, she will most likely have to give the Male ter'angreals etc in the White Tower\nto the Black Tower, Egwene said that she'd think on it and get back to him, though in\nher mind she is very pissed that Kinje brought such a mouthy White Tower Sedai with him,\nand being a stuborn Two Rivers girl in her mind doesn't want to make a deal with the Black\nTower when Kinje looked like a tool of Gavriela's. So she's going over kinje's head to\nspeak to Rand about this 'allinace' thing that is being spoken of, and to perhaps tactfully\ntell Rand that she was 'threatened' by the Tower. Analinde has signed the Rebel book, and\nis to be raised to the White Ajah once her lessons are done being taught by Nadia. *I'm\nmailing Maelyn about this to be handled* Analinde is concerned about taking the oaths,\nEgwene has expressed that there maybe a way that Analinde can be Aes Sedai, *or have\nher training completed anyway* and not have to take the Oats, but Egwene hasn't promised\nthat fully yet.\n  \nAs far as everything else goes...I can't remember any other major plots that\nI was involved with/was planning. Uhhh... last words...Try to have fun, no point\nin being here if it isn't fun. I most certainly enjoyed my time here has an immortal\nand Implementor, however brief.

It's your city so you're in\ncharge of coordinating the descripting efforts of anybody you\ncan get to help - I'd ask Nenae, Phaedra and Quinlan for\nstarters - they've all worked on the ubermap - and maybe\nBethany as well (she's been bored during the day).  Here's\nwhere we're at:\n\nI constructed all of zone 90 and 91 (all numbered rooms on\nyour map) - the city should be fully working except for the\nmissing tower and the missing descs.  It's connected to\nthe bridges, which connect to the ubermap.  I also redid\nAlindaer (a half assed job but it's ok), and imported it as\nwell - the bridge to Alindaer connects to your city like it\nshould.  The other bridges just pop out at the squares on\nthe ubermap where the towns would go (see the website:)\n`^http://www.engr.umd.edu/ maeillo/index2.htm`7  and\n`^http://www.engr.umd.edu/ maeillo/TV_city2_feb_7.bmp`7\n\nPlease come up with a color scheme for the city, and use it\nin the title of the red rooms on your map.  Like `3T`#a`2r V`2a`#lo`3n`7\nor something, but pretty :p All the cities have all their gates\nmarked that way, and each city has its own color scheme.\nLemme know what it is, cuz we'll have references to it outside\nthe city, as well.  Up to you what colors you want :>\n\nIf you find any mistakes, lemme know.  I may have to do some\nadditional pfile setting for everybody to be able to edit the city,\nbut I can't remember everybody's BP names offhand so just\nlet me know or get another imm to set you.  I can do it offline\nif you send me a list of names, too.\n\nThere is one mistake that I fixed - but just so you know, the way\nit's built right now is correct, so don't change it :p On your map,\nthere are two adjacent rooms numbered 9084 - the one of the\nright is now 9011, since there is no 9011 anywhere else.  There\nis another 9085 tho, so I kept it where it was and just recycled\n9011.  It should be right.\n\nI adjusted the 'goto tv' and 'goto al' (alindaer) markers.  Alindaer\nworks exactly like caemlyn's does, and tv just pops you out at\nin the yellow squares on your map.\n\nBesides just the city itself, the river around the city also needs\nto be descripted, as do the bridges and the one-room villages\naround the city.  They can stay one room for now, but they do\nneed a desc and the name from the books.\n\nYou can do all new descs if you so desire, but you can also\npirate some of the current TV ones if you like.  Ranulf mentioned\nthe Silver Swan (never looked at it), but it'd be cool if you could\nreconstruct it as one of the inns as well, since there's a couple\npeople that RP there on the main port.  Also, start deciding how\nto use the white tower - if you want to just slap it as is in the\nmiddle of the city, or if we need to adjust it, or what.  It's your\nguild area and your call what you want to do with it.\n\nUmm.  I think that's it.  I'll be around off and on for large chunks\nof time to help, but mailing me is fastest.  Feel free to beep me\nif you guys need anything. :> Have fun, and thanks :)\n\n-Nic\n

Sorry, i've had a bit of trouble sending this so I don't know what you recieved.\n\nYou glance around your gaze falling upon her, her ice blue eyes shimmering softly.\nOn the right side of her beautiful face there appears to be an odd red design painted \non, covering most of it. Her long dark brown hair hangs down her back in an intricate\nbraid that reaches slightly past her waist. She wears a tight black coat embroidered \nin silver. Under the coat she wears a loose white blouse tucked into her tight fitting \nblack leather pants.  Her black boots come up over her pant legs and end just\nbelow her kness. A black leather strap trimmed in silver hangs over her shoulder \nand across her chest. The strap connects to a long slightly curved black leather \nscabbard trimmed in silver, on her back. A foot long hilt extends from the scabbard\nup over her shoulder, the hilt and cross guard are wrapped in black leather strips. \nWell crafted silver work can be seen from beneath the leather strips, on the pommel, \nand over the cross guard. On her right forearm is a black steel parrying bracer also\nwrapped in black leather strips with a small bit of silver work showing inbetween the\nstrips. Worn on the ring finger of her right hand is an odd ring of silver which appears\nto be a dozen serpents entwined together with small emeralds inset for their eyes,\n\nChrista was born into house Damodred about twenty years ago. Her father was a \nminor noble of the house and her mother was a noble of a smaller house, House Kaer. \nShe grew up with two older brothers a three or four off from her own age. Her mother \ndied from natural causes during child birth with her. Having no real female role-model \nshe turned out to be a tom boy. Her nurse tried her best to keep her in dresses and \nteach her the things she would need to be a lady in Cairhien. She excelled in her \nstudies be it history, court intrigue, or anything else. Only having to be shown or told \nsomething once she would remember it without any problem. As a child she was found \nmore often out playing with her brothers and the other boys well they practice the sword, \nwhich is where she learned what skill she has, then with anyone her own age or sex. \nOften causing trouble or playing pranks, she was a mischievious child. At about the age \nof eighteen her father arranged for her to marry. In secret she hired a blacksmith to make \nher the sword and bracer she now carries and a silver smith to do the silver work on bracer \nand sword. After the completion she gathered a few belongings, changes of clothes and \nher mothers ring, and some coin. She ran away to become a Hunter for the Horn. Traveling \nto Illian to take the oaths. She reached Illian in time to take the oaths using her mothers \nmaiden name she traveled far and wide searching for the horn to no avail ending up in the \nTwo Rivers area during the time when the Trollocs attacked(the second time). She came \nacross a lone trolloc who attacked her. She was saved when a young Two Rivers boy put \nan arrow through the beast. Realizing her own in-ability to protect her self she set off for the \nTower in Tar Valon to learn from the warders. Her only goal, next to that of finding the Horn, \nto become a blade master.\ngoing on at the time. Some I would like to try to reestablish even with the lack of the players \nfrom then. She was a distinguished Hunter for the Horn and had recieved training from two \nwarders/blade masters from the tower. One was the Aiel blade master Tarkan(sp?). The other \nI can no longer remember his name after so long. She had also been inducted into the \nCompanions of Illian by Lord Brend/Sammael himself unknowing that he was one of the \nforsaken. She had considerable training from the two warders in emote fighting. As well as I \nhave had years of experience emote fighting before even coming to A Moment in Tyme on \nProdigy's RP chat. If you need any other information just e-mail me back I will do what I can. \nThe background is fairly rough I wrote it in about a half an hour so it may need a little work.\n

His grandfather taught him how to ride the horses he sold, and his father and his many\nfriends taught the boy how to shoot an arrow straight, and to fight with a lance and the twin\nswords of Arafel.  It was the time he spent with his grandfather's hostlers and drivers,\nhowever, that influenced the boy's youth the most.  He grew up pulling pranks on or with them,\nrunning errands, and cheating at cards.  As he grew older and seedier, his parents grew worried\nabout his habits, and his mother bought Lothair Mentelar's book, "The Way of the Light" for\nthe young man.  He read it, and gave every appearance of enjoying it.  In fact, from the day\nhe finished the book, he began declaring that he would leave for the Southlands as soon as\nhe was old enough, and join the Children of the Light.  Now, this development worried his\nparents even more than his previous antics, and they began spoiling the boy, hoping to entice\nhim to stay in Arafel with them.  Instead, when he turned 17, he took everything they had\ngiven him that was portable, stole weapons and a horse, and headed south.  He is currently\nin Caemlyn, having spent all of his money thus far, and needing to make some more before moving\non to Amador.\n

Lacking the glee base to fill the playhouse and run productions, we can't really justify the kind of IC organization necessary to have a large overblown structure, nor do we necessarily want to.  This is ICly the work of one or two individuals who've made a fair living for themselves, maybe earned a few favours, and now want to settle down and enjoy their older years - and maybe offer a helping hand to them as needs it.

The Lion's Banner has been suggested, as it has never had any player owner, and is already large enough and spaced well enough, and, well, can be ICly destroyed enough to easily result in a change of title.

It'd give us a small, low key, IC area, which, rather than drawing RP away from other areas on the MUD, might provide another focus point, most of which is fully accessible to all players.  I and the other glees would be happy to help with any desc work needed, though we'd request permission to make some moderately extensive use of extra descs (I'm going to have poems on the walls), locked doors, and perhaps a second vault room which could serve as a library such as you and I spoke of.  Unlike most guild areas this probably wouldn't involve private rooms for most of the characters.  If you can afford a private room, you rent one.  If we ever grow enough to legitimately need more, well... there is the theatre district, and a playhouse was coded for avilyn long ago that could be used.\n`8.`7\nThats the basics.

He worked\nand trained hard while Gareth Bryne was Commander of the gaurds,\nand was appauled when Bryne was removed from his office.

Telo fought the shadowspawn that\nerupted in Caemlyn when Andor was taken by the Dragon Reborn, and\nsince then, has heard rumor of Gareth Bryne leading a new band\nof forces in the south.  Telo has inquired of this, but has not\nheard anything substantial to follow up on.\n \nDescription:\n  The man is of average height, with short sandy blonde hair that\nis cut to less than an inch in length.  He has soft, brown eyes\nthat take in his surroundings.  He has a smooth face, which seems\nto be perfectly balanced.  He is of sturdy build, and from the\nlooks of him he keeps his body well trained.  His skin is slightly\ndarkened from a tan that never seems to fade.\n \n  Around his neck is a simple turqoise stone that has been shaped\ninto a small dagger, about an inch tall.  The stone hangs from his\nneck by a leather string, falling to his mid-chest.  He wears a\ndark red cloth shirt, with long sleeves that are rolled back to\nhis elbows.  The shirt has many small silver buttons up the front,\nand is tucked neatly into his loose leather riding pants.  Around\nhis waist he wears a thick, black leather belt.  On the left hip\nrests a longsword tucked into a sturdy wooden sheath, and a dagger\nhangs from the right hip.  The leather riding pants are tucked\nneatly into a pair of black leather knee-high boots he wears on\nhis feet, with small silver spurs on the heels.\n

Her father, not really knowing\nwhat to do with a daughter, raised her the best he could\nbut still ended up with quite a tomboy. Kagari's first\nlove was horses, and she knew everything there was to\nknow about riding by the time she was twelve. She even\nlearned how to shoe a horse, much to the farrier's amusement.\n\nWhen Kagari was seventeen, she began running parcels for\npeople back and forth between the small towns out in the\nbackwoods part of Andor she lived in, but one day she\nreturned home to find her farm in ashes, and all the horses\nstolen. With noplace else to go, she began working for\ntravelling merchants, tending to their horses and helping\nout in stables: anything she could do to make enough money to\nlive on.\n\nShe saw a lot of Andor, and even a little bit of Murandy, but\none day while stopped over in Caemlyn, her employer came back\nto the inn, drunk, and insisted she saddle the horses which she\nhad only finished grooming a few minutes before. She would\nhave been fine: the man wasn't cruel or violent, but before she\ncould get a word in, a pair of black-coated men had threatened\nthe poor merchant enough to scare him right out of the inn.\nKagari didn't feel that she could keep on working for him after\nthat, so she's been stuck in Caemlyn ever since, finding odd jobs\nrunning parcels up and down along the road north of Caemlyn.\nOnce on a run, she met a hunter with yellow eyes who didn't share\nhis name, but who made her horse pretty nervous for some reason.\nOther than that, she's had no contact yet with wolves or wolfkin.\n\nI hope that'll do: the last paragraph is all of the actual rp I've\ndone with this character so far. I'm only level four, but there\ndidn't appear to be a requirement, so I'll just keep going as I\nhave been unless I hear differently.\n\nYours in the Light,\nKagari\n

With noplace else to go, she began working for\ntravelling merchants, tending to their horses and helping\nout in stables: anything she could do to make enough money to\nlive on.\n\nShe saw a lot of Andor, and even a little bit of Murandy, but\none day while stopped over in Caemlyn, her employer came back\nto the inn, drunk, and insisted she saddle the horses which she\nhad only finished grooming a few minutes before. She would\nhave been fine: the man wasn't cruel or violent, but before she\ncould get a word in, a pair of black-coated men had threatened\nthe poor merchant enough to scare him right out of the inn.\nKagari didn't feel that she could keep on working for him after\nthat, so she's been stuck in Caemlyn ever since, finding odd jobs\nrunning parcels up and down along the road north of Caemlyn.\nOnce on a run, she met a hunter with yellow eyes who didn't share\nhis name, but who made her horse pretty nervous for some reason.\nOther than that, she's had no contact yet with wolves or wolfkin.\n\nI hope that'll do: the last paragraph is all of the actual rp I've\ndone with this character so far. I'm only level four, but there\ndidn't appear to be a requirement, so I'll just keep going as I\nhave been unless I hear differently.\n\nYours in the Light,\nKagari\n

Let me know if the background is acceptable please.	\n`7--] `6A Moment in Tyme MUD Mail System`7 [--\n`7Date`6:`7 Fri Jun 17 06:27:11 2005\n`7From`6:`7 Cashik\n`7Subj`6:`7 Here is a background for Simion's re-name.  I'd like to keep my position in the Asha'man if that is alright.  Let me know if the background is acceptable please.\n`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7\nCashik was born in Mayene near the coast bordering the Sea of Storms.  His father was a trader with the Seafolk.  Cashik's mother died when he was very young, from sickness, and so, his father raised the boy alone.  Cashik was born on the exact day that is the feast of Bel Tine.  It is a belief in some parts of Mayene that if a child is born on the Great Feast then a great destiny awaits them.\n\nFrom an early age, Cashik aspired to be part of the Mayene military.  Stories of the famed Winged Guards and the resistance they led against the oppressive Tairen's made him feel proud to live in Mayene.  Even though Tear claims Mayene is a province, Mayeners strongly refute this, and they fight to maintain their independence.\n\nCashik trained hard as a youth, studying the martial arts of the region and swordplay.  It was tough for him at first because he had little money for a tutor but he found a job trading like his father, and that was suitable for him and it helped along his progress.  He had only one real goal in life, and that was to become one of the famed Winged Guards he had heard so much about.\n\nHe eventually made it in to the military but it seemed fate had more in store for him than that.  His ability to channel manifested itself slowly and he was unaware of it at first.  Unexpected events and excessive luck led him to be given the name 'Machin' by his comrades.  They called him such because he was so fast, able to bend the flow of air about himself without realising it.  His light frame and sharp mind also helped him a great deal.  Not very strong, Cashik uses his speed to his advantage in battle.\n\nA number of skirmishes was really all Cashik saw in his first few years serving in the Winged Guards.  The Tairen's launched attacks from time to time, in their efforts to conquer Mayene, but the Mayener's always seemed to have the upper hand, their nation much like a fortress in itself, surrounded by mountains, raging seas and of course, the drowned lands - a swampy terrain filled with dangerous predators.  The Tairen's never really stood much of a chance and so they more often resorted to assassins instead, and tried to cut off Mayene's supplies. \n\nCashik was one of many very pleased Mayeners when Tear fell, and to the Dragon Reborn no less, aided by the Aiel.  The news spread quickly through the land, finally the fighting was over and Tear would not bother them any more, and yet, deep down they all knew that lurking around the corner a far greater battle was to come.  With the Dragon Reborn's arrival, his taking of the Stone of Tear as was written in the prophecies, there was little doubt in Cashik's mind that Tarmon Gai'don was coming.  Everyone could feel it as the land began to turn dry and burn under the endless days of scorching sun.  An un-natural head that never seemed to end.\n\nCashik took it upon himself to volunteer straight away when Berelain travelled to the Stone.  He wanted to continue to protect Mayene, nothing mattered more to him, but it was clear to him that the battle was no longer to be fought in his home land.  Trollocs and Fades, creatures he had long thought to be myth, he found out were real.  The Aiel had come across the Spine of the World, the Dark One was starting to break free from his prison.\n\nThe Stone was flooded with Shadowspawn soon after his arrival, and all his training flew out of the window when that first eyeless stare settled upon him.  Unable to move, paralysed by it, he thought he would die there and then.  And yet the creature he encountered hesitated.  To this day, Cashik still remembers that event of his life more clearly than any other and it puzzles him greatly.  Some Fades were rumoured to even be fighting each other, Trollocs as well, they appeared in a chaotic state.\n\n Because of the Dragon Reborn the shadowspawn were defeated and the people in Stone spared, and Cashik witnessed that power with awe, lighting bolts streaking down the corridors, striking into the Fades and Trollocs and destroying them.  He felt the radiance of menace coming from the man and fell to his knees in worship of that power.  Still very much unaware that he could channel, Cashik continued in ignorance believing that everyone could feel it, those odd times when he saw the Dragon Reborn down the corridor and felt that menace.  He never once mentioned it, believing it was simply his power radiating off him, because he was who he was.\n\nIt was only a few years later, in Caemlyn, that he really found out what he was, when one of the newly formed group called the Asha'man came across him in Palace.  As they tested the men who had travelled from all over the world, for the amnesty, Cashik again felt that twinge of menace.  Investigating its source brought him to the Asha'man, and after a long process he agreed to be tested as well, out of curiosity more than anything else.\n\nThe confirmation actually came as a real shock to him and as he considered what he should do, he found the decision made for him.  The Asha'man took him to the Black Tower despite his protests about his duty to Berelain.  It is likely that the Lord Captain of the Winged Guards would have let Cashik go willingly, submitting to the will of the Dragon Reborn and so, of the Asha'man.  A letter of resignation was written and sent from Cashik and he began his life anew.\n\nAs a Recruit in the Black Tower, he found himself quickly humbled by the harsh regime.  Something called a 'block' Cashik found had to be broken before he could learn to channel.  Apparently his was always anger - at the Tairens.  To bring that anger out, a Tairen Soldier was the obvious choice, and it was broken with a fierce display that had him beaten to the ground until all that was left was nothingness.  He was able to hold Saidin freely from that day forth and, after he recovered, he began, learning, developing particular skill with air and fire.  His restlessness at being held at the Farm was toned down by the amazing power he found he could wield.  Consumed by it, always seeking to improve himself, he often had to be told to 'stop' to avoid burning himself out.  \n\nFireballs, lightning, balls of light, shields of air, the ability to make things explode, never in his wildest dreams did Cashik believe such things were possible, but he learned to make them happen, realising that the adaptations could be endless.  He waits for his Soldier test, eager to get out there and put his new found skills to good use.\n

If this next would be a problem to keep, it\ncan be taken out without any problem.  However, if it isn't\na problem, I'd just as rather keep it, with a few changes.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n-\nCathbad was shielded my a male channeler, which marked the\nfirst flows Cathbad really saw.  He was led out of the Oval\nto some other place, where he was given the option of going\nwith them to a place where he could learn to Channel and be\na weapon, or eventually going insane and causing a big mess.\n-\nHaving no desire to harm anyone, Cathbad outright refused to\njoin the group, since leaving the Illuminators would mean\nbetraying his heritage.  So, they gave him a third option,\nto serve as their spy.  Coincidently, the person who let him\nchoose this option wasn't long for the world (left Tyme),\nand no Asha ever bothered Cathbad again, until it happened\nagain (to the same effect).\n-\nWhat I'd like to keep is that he was given the option to\nlearn, though it was to be as the Dragon's weapon, and he\nrefused on those grounds.  This being in the early stages,\nof Asha gathering, I'm guessing he was a 'lost recruit'\nor something (I don't know Asha current policy).\n-\nEssentially, they might know there was one who didn't take\nto recruitment in the Caemlyn area, but despite the /small/\narea, Cathbad still spends most of his time in the Illum\nChapterhouse, only coming out for the rare visit outside\ntheir grounds.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n-\nNow, fast-forward a while, and Cathbad had gotten over the\nsickness that comes with first channeling on his own.\n-\nI heavily considered having Cathbad succumb to the pains of\nbeing a Wilder, and die, and left it up to RL dice.  It\nsounds odd, but yes, I did, leaving a 01-25 on %ile dice to\nCathbad living.  What came up was a 24%.  I came to use the\nRL dice to sim in RP what % grasp/weave/release I had in\ncode.\n-\nAs far as a block, Cathbad's was two-fold.  First, he could\nonly sieze Saidin when he was angry or filled with hate or\ndisgust, and second, his weaves needed an accompanying\nphysical gesture to work.\n-\nSimilar to Nynaeve, Cathbad began to learn to force himself\nto become angry enough to channel, but still, was loathe to\neven when circumstances were against him.\n-\nMost of the time, when things turned ill, Cathbad would use\nsome Illuminator trick to escape, rather than Channeling.\n-\nEventually, he got decent at weaving a bit of air, though\nhas not practiced much of the other.

If this next would be a problem to keep, it\ncan be taken out without any problem.  However, if it isn't\na problem, I'd just as rather keep it, with a few changes.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n-\nCathbad was shielded my a male channeler, which marked the\nfirst flows Cathbad really saw.  He was led out of the Oval\nto some other place, where he was given the option of going\nwith them to a place where he could learn to Channel and be\na weapon, or eventually going insane and causing a big mess.\n-\nHaving no desire to harm anyone, Cathbad outright refused to\njoin the group, since leaving the Illuminators would mean\nbetraying his heritage.  So, they gave him a third option,\nto serve as their spy.  Coincidently, the person who let him\nchoose this option wasn't long for the world (left Tyme),\nand no Asha ever bothered Cathbad again, until it happened\nagain (to the same effect).\n-\nWhat I'd like to keep is that he was given the option to\nlearn, though it was to be as the Dragon's weapon, and he\nrefused on those grounds.  This being in the early stages,\nof Asha gathering, I'm guessing he was a 'lost recruit'\nor something (I don't know Asha current policy).\n-\nEssentially, they might know there was one who didn't take\nto recruitment in the Caemlyn area, but despite the /small/\narea, Cathbad still spends most of his time in the Illum\nChapterhouse, only coming out for the rare visit outside\ntheir grounds.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n-\nNow, fast-forward a while, and Cathbad had gotten over the\nsickness that comes with first channeling on his own.\n-\nI heavily considered having Cathbad succumb to the pains of\nbeing a Wilder, and die, and left it up to RL dice.  It\nsounds odd, but yes, I did, leaving a 01-25 on %ile dice to\nCathbad living.  What came up was a 24%.  I came to use the\nRL dice to sim in RP what % grasp/weave/release I had in\ncode.\n-\nAs far as a block, Cathbad's was two-fold.  First, he could\nonly sieze Saidin when he was angry or filled with hate or\ndisgust, and second, his weaves needed an accompanying\nphysical gesture to work.\n-\nSimilar to Nynaeve, Cathbad began to learn to force himself\nto become angry enough to channel, but still, was loathe to\neven when circumstances were against him.\n-\nMost of the time, when things turned ill, Cathbad would use\nsome Illuminator trick to escape, rather than Channeling.\n-\nEventually, he got decent at weaving a bit of air, though\nhas not practiced much of the other.  He'd prefer to not\nuse it, because if he goes mad, there is the chance his\ninsane uses of the One Power could blow up the Chapterhouse\nand a fair section of Caemlyn as well.\n-\nCathbad eventually got to be able to grasp and release\ndecently well, though it is not always certain, even if he\nis angry.  Sometimes, Saidin is loathe to release from his\ngrasp (aka lower release).  As to tying weaves, Cathbad\nhas no knowledge of it.\n-\nThe reason I only did minor Air stuff was that Cathbad\nonly had one Weave, and that was Dart of Air.\n-\nOne thing I'm leaving out is that Cathbad was on scene for\nan assassination the Asha'man attempted, failed, and fled\nfrom.  In it, Cath dove to the right, avoiding a deadly\ndisc of air being hurled at him, though Cath's two npc\nguards died, not being able to see what was coming.  That,\nand Cathbad got Shielded again.  There was a policy issue\nwith one of the Asha doing 8 things at once, and some\nother muck.  Of course, this was 2 rp-shifts ago, so, I'm\nfine with it going the way of the dodo.\n-\nI would like Cathbad to begin experimenting with a few\nthings.  The first of these being small weaves of fire,\nseeing if he can light things, specifically if he can\ntouch off one thing while nearby items remain unsinged.\n-\nThe second being Earth weaves.  By now, Cathbad would\nhave probably heard of the five flows, and may have\nconsidered trying to turn one substance into another.\nMostly, for refining exisitng firework materials and\ndeveloping new ones.\n-\nAs to where he could've heard of the flows, well, I had\nan RP going with a Yellow (probably gone now) that\nCathbad was Eyes/Ears for, and who promised to keep his\nsecret (didn't know what it was until said).

Please read and let me know if it is okay for Cashik to be in the Asha'man in Simion's place.  (Simion died and Cashik is his rename.)  All stats are being transferred -still-, and it is taking forever....  Simion was ready to take the Soldier test I think, and yet you had not set him with any of the channeling skills - all my 'grasp' 'tie' 'weave' etc skills were still set to 'unskilled'  Also, Simion was a recruit for waaaay longer than he should have been, considering all he learned, he should have had the test.  \nI have logs to back that up as well!\nHere is Cashik's background:\nCashik was born in Mayene near the coast bordering the Sea of Storms.  His father was a trader with the Seafolk.  Cashik's mother died when he was very young, from sickness, and so, his father raised the boy alone.  Cashik was born on the exact day that is the feast of Bel Tine.  It is a belief in some parts of Mayene that if a child is born on the Great Feast then a great destiny awaits them.\nFrom an early age, Cashik aspired to be part of the Mayene military.  Stories of the famed Winged Guards and the resistance they led against the oppressive Tairen's made him feel proud to live in Mayene.  Even though Tear claimed Mayene as a province, Mayeners strongly refuted this, and they kept fighting to maintain their independence.\nCashik trained hard as a youth, studying the martial arts of the region and swordplay.  It was tough for him at first because he had little money for a tutor but he found a job trading like his father, and that was suitable for him and helped along his progress.  He had only one real goal in life, and that was to become one of the famed Winged Guards he had heard so much about.\nHe eventually made it into the military but it seemed fate had more in store for him than that.  His ability to channel manifested itself slowly and he was unaware of it at first.  Unexpected events and excessive luck led him to be given the name 'Machin' by his comrades.  They called him such because he was so fast, able to bend the flow of air about himself without realising it.  His light frame and sharp mind also helped him a great deal.  Not very strong, Cashik uses his speed to advantage in battle.\nA number of skirmishes was really all Cashik was in his first few years serving in the Winged Guards.  The Tairen's launched attacks from time to time, in their efforts to conquer Mayene, but the Mayener's always seemed to have the upper hand, their nation much like a fortress in itself, surrounded by mountains, raging seas and of course, the drowned lands - a swampy terrain filled with dangerous predators.  The Tairen's never really stood much of a chance and so they more often resorted to assasins instead and tried to cut off Mayene's supplies.\nCashik was one of many very pleased Mayener's when Tear fell, and to the Dragon Reborn no less, aided by the Aiel.  The news spread quickly throughout the land, finally the fighting was over and Tear would not bother them any more, and yet, deep down they all knew that lurking around the corner a far greater battle was to come.  With the Dragon Reborn's arrival, his taking of the Stone of Tear as was written in the prophecies, there was little doubt in Cashik's mind that Tarmon Gaidon was coming.  Everyone could feel it as the land began to turn dry and burn under the endless days of scorching sun.  An un-natural heat that never seemed to end.\nCashik took it upon himself to volunteer straight away when Berelain travelled to the Stone.  He wanted to continue to protect Mayene, nothing mattered more to him, but it was clear to him that the battle was no longer to be fought in his home land.  Trollocs and Fades, creatures he had long thought to be myth, he found out were real.  The Aiel had come across the Spien of the World, the Dark One was starting to break free from his prison.\nThe Stone was flooded with Shadowspawn soon after his arrival, and all his training flew out of the window when that first eyeless stare settled upon him.  Unable to move, paralysed by it, he thought he would die there and then.  And yet the creature he encountered hesitated.  To this day, Cashik still remembers that event of his life more clearly than any other and it puzzles him greatly.  Some Fades were rumoured to even be fighting each other, Trollocs as well, they appeared to be in a chaotic state.\nBecause of the Dragon Reborn the shadowspawn were defeated and the people in the Stone spared, and Cashik witnessed that power with awe, lighting bolts streaking down the corridors, striking into the Fades and Trollocs and destroying them.  He felt the radiance of menace coming from the man and fell to his knees in worship of that power.  Still vey much unaware that he could channel, Cashik continued in ignorance believing that everyone could feel it, those odd times when he saw the Dragon Reborn down the corridor and felt that menace.  He never once mentioned it, believing it was simply his power radiating off him, because he was who he was.\nIt was only a few years later, in Caemlyn, that he found out what he was, when one of the newly formed group called the Asha'man came across him in the Palace.  As they tested the men who had travelled from all over the world, for the amnesty, Cashik again felt that twinge of menace.  Investigating its source brought him to the Asha'man, and after a long process he agreed to be tested as well, out of curiosity more than anything else.\nThe confirmation actually came as a real shock to him and as he considered what he should do, he found the decision made for him.  The Asha'man took him to the Black Tower despite his protests about his duty to Berelain.  It is likely that the Lord Captain of the Winged Guards would have let Cashik go willingly, submitting to the will of the Dragon Reborn and so, of the Asha'man.  A letter of resignation was written and sent from Cashik and he began his life anew.\nAs a Recruit in the Black Tower, he found himself quickly humbled by the harsh regime.  Something called a 'block' Cashik found had to be broken before he could learn to channel.  Apparently his was always anger - at the Tairens.  To bring that anger out, a Tairen Soldier was the obvious choice, and it was broken with a fierce display that had him beaten to the ground until all that was left was nothingness.  He was able to hold Saidin freely from that day forth and, after he recovered, he began learning, developing particular skill with air and fire.  His restlessness at being held at the Farm was toned down by the amazing power he found he could wield.\n

I seek to join the White Tower as a Novice, and to arrange\nfor the necessary RP with one of your guildees who can bring be in and get\nme started.  I read the short story of where we currently are in the\ntime line, when I log on.  I was hoping you could enlighten me further on\nhow I can successfully join the guild, since I am some what confused on the\ncondition of Tar Valon and the White Tower.\n\nHere is my short Biography:\n\nFrom birth to the age of fifteen, Anousha had lived in the respectful nation\nof Andor with both her parents.  Their house, a small but comfortable farm a\nlittle west of Caemlyn's east gate and east of Four Kings, was build by\nAnousha's father before she was born.  With the money he had, he bought the\nlands where their house sits, and some land about it, and started up a small\ncrop farm to bring in an earning he could live on.  What he didn't expect\nwas that in this kingdom, he would meet the woman he would love, Elisha.\nHer visit was a surprise, her carriage had broken, a wheel fractured from a\nstray rock across the main road.  What she saw in her father was more than\njust looks.  He was far from the most handsome man to bare this earth, but\nhe was great with words, and perhaps the exotic of his origin was an\nattraction, and Illian far from his homeland.  He offered to fix the\ncarriage, and gave her a roof to sleep under for the night and when she\nleft, it was only two days since, when they met again at the market.  He was\nselling his goods, she was buying her vegetables.\n\nSince the age of eight, Anousha would be fed the same stories by her father,\nabout life in Illian, about why he left.  The tension and the hatred between\nthe cities of Illian and Tear.  How he felt bad about being in the center of\nit, not wanting to be part of it anymore and seeking a new life to the\nnorth.  Then the trip he spent three years to save and prepare for, of the\nadventures of a the young Illian Biron.  Anousha never grew bored of the\nstories, hoping he might write a book of it.  She always sat and smiled when\nher Father's eyes grew wide, and his words and expressions together brought\nlife to the story.  He could be a Gleeman, Anousha would think, but never\nmentioned it.\n\nThe three of them lived comfortably at their farm.  Not rich, but not\nexactly poor.  They could afford the odd luxury, and by saving up for a\nnumber of years, they bought Anousha's education.  Having an Illian Father\nand an Andoran Mother had an affect on her accent.  Most would think she was\nIllian, but she did speak like one, at least, not most of the time.  The odd\n'do be' did slip from her tongue, but it came as fluent as any Illian might\nuse it.\n\nHope to hear from you soon.\n\nAnousha\n

He had apparently been left to die.\n\nThe women who ran the orphanage were cruel. They raised their children more as\nslaves than as loved wards, putting the children to work cooking, cleaning and\nbegging on the streets, keeping them in check with either promises of putting\nthe children out in the cold to fend for themselves or beating a fear of leaving\ninto them.\n\nNaturally, Theodoric was a part of this vicious upbringing, as well as the abuse\nthat came from the older children in the orphanage. He was a small child, thin\nwith an odd appearance. This was more than enough reason to be singled out by the\nothers for teasing and fights and other types of more disturbing abuse. Thus, it\nwas early on in life that Theodoric withdrew into himself, becoming a withdrawn\nand cold boy with no care or love for anything in the world. Another important\ndevelopment in this stage of his life was the first manifestation of his ability\nto channel. Certain situations in the orphanage, the most terrible ones, would\ntrigger a reaction in the boy that he could not describe or control, but which\nwould help him nonetheless. He found that, when that trigger went off inside him,\nhe would "lash out" at the person or people involved, causing varying types of\nreactions in the victims. Some would feel tremendous pain, others go into fits of\nconvulsions. Once, he was pushed so far that his reaction killed the other person.\nIt was at this time, in his mid-teen years, that the two orphanage women kicked\nhim out on the street, now afraid that his whispered power would eventually be\nturned on them.\n\nTheodoric travelled out of Caemlyn, begging his way at first. His thoroughly\ningrained psychotic qualities coupled with his poverty lead him quickly from\nbegging to more rewarding, if not permanent, means of satisfying his needs. He\nwould rob people for their money and he even killed two or three of his victims,\nwith no care for the consequences. In turn, his lifestyle also exposed him to\nbigger, stronger and meaner people who would in turn rob him. Twice, attempts were\nmade to kill him, but his innate, self-defense mechanism would kick in, and twice\nhe killed a man without even touching him.\n\nIn his mid-twenties, Theodoric tired even of this life and left the city to travel\nthe lands. He travelled east to Cairhien, where he hired on as a nobleman's spy,\nusing his ability with a dagger and his cold nature to serve his master. For five\nyears, he has been working for this nobleman, which has now brought him to Caemlyn\nagain.\n\nHis innate ability to cause pain and reactions under extreme duress is obviously\na manifestation of his ability to channel. He has the potential to be a powerful\nchanneler if given the proper training and being in Caemlyn will give him the\nnecessary exposure to the Asha'man to allow him to leave his current employment\nfor their ranks.\n\nNote:\nIf you are willing to credit me with training to a full rank in the Asha'man based\non past experience, then this background ends just after the Asha'man were found.\nTheodoric joined among the first of the recruits, displayed a thirst to learn the\nability to focus and control his power as well as a cold, calculating, uncaring\nmanner with which he could kill.

Where he was born is a mystery to him, and to make it worse his parents hardly remember. They were always on the move, particularly as Merchants or at least that was the faade. Kailen was still young when he began thieving, killing, stealing and smuggling. \nStarting in Caemlyn, he slowly worked his way around Andor, never staying in one place for long, fearing he might overstay his welcome. Wherever there was good "business", Kailen traveled there. When he was in his mid twenties, he ended up in Saldea where he met Misha. After meeting Misha and falling in love, he wanted to try and keep his business honest as possible, but his past caught up with him and the money was too great to turn away. \nMisha, as good a woman as she was, cared little about his Kailen's business. After a few years of dating, and working together, they married. Once Misha was with child, near their early thirties, the two decided to take to the road and keep on the move so that no one knew where they were. Marek was born somewhere along those travels along the way.\nKailen decided it would be best after a few years of traveling to move back to Andor, and "set up shop" so to speak. With the money the two made, and Marek now a few years old, they bought a small house near the woods nearest Caemlyn, Kailen's old territory. It was there that The Red Dagger was born. By the time Marek was ten years old, Kailen had seven men that served him, with skills that are not considered lawful in most cases.\nThey were and are to this day his eyes, his ears, his dagger and sword. Misha fell into the background in most of this, being a loving mother was all that she worried about, regardless of the life she undoubtedly knew her son would someday have. At the age of fourteen, Kailen began teaching Marek how to throw daggers, climb trees, houses and walls, pick locks, and fight with daggers and short swords. By the time Marek was eighteen, Kailen's grasp on the business had tightened and his power increased by much, and his reach by far.\nOwning several lucrative establishments around the known world, owning a mine in the Mountain of Mists, and of course expanding The Red Dagger. The group that was once a single man now consisted of Kailen and thirteen other men. It was at this point that Marek was initiated into the group, and his training truly began.\nEach of the men that served Kailen then had their chance to teach Marek the trade that each specialized in. Marek was taught about everything from poisons to traps, from tightrope walking to pick locking, from hunting to combat. He was going to be part of the team soon and they needed him to be at his best.\n\nThere it is in all of its glory :-P Feel free to mail me back around what you think of it, or just talk to me online.\nAny questions, comments, concerns, flames, etc. Just tell me.\n\nTravis\nPlayer of: Eradin, Jerryn, Owen, Draen, Marek.\n

With the money the two made, and Marek now a few years old, they bought a small house near the woods nearest Caemlyn, Kailen's old territory. It was there that The Red Dagger was born. By the time Marek was ten years old, Kailen had seven men that served him, with skills that are not considered lawful in most cases.\nThey were and are to this day his eyes, his ears, his dagger and sword. Misha fell into the background in most of this, being a loving mother was all that she worried about, regardless of the life she undoubtedly knew her son would someday have. At the age of fourteen, Kailen began teaching Marek how to throw daggers, climb trees, houses and walls, pick locks, and fight with daggers and short swords. By the time Marek was eighteen, Kailen's grasp on the business had tightened and his power increased by much, and his reach by far.\nOwning several lucrative establishments around the known world, owning a mine in the Mountain of Mists, and of course expanding The Red Dagger. The group that was once a single man now consisted of Kailen and thirteen other men. It was at this point that Marek was initiated into the group, and his training truly began.\nEach of the men that served Kailen then had their chance to teach Marek the trade that each specialized in. Marek was taught about everything from poisons to traps, from tightrope walking to pick locking, from hunting to combat. He was going to be part of the team soon and they needed him to be at his best.\n\nThere it is in all of its glory :-P Feel free to mail me back around what you think of it, or just talk to me online.\nAny questions, comments, concerns, flames, etc. Just tell me.\n\nTravis\nPlayer of: Eradin, Jerryn, Owen, Draen, Marek.\n

He was the only son of the High Lord Mithriddin, supposed to grow to be the greatest warrior ever of the Hyara house, and the next High Lord of the house. House Hyara was noble and did not tolerate Shaitan. They usually made Lords of battle, who would fight the evil along to Borderlands. Mithrid though, never received his full training from the Hyara house, only a year he was trained, and his weapon skills adequate with a sword and small with a bow.

As they traveled, shadow spawn followed, with darkfriends, allowing the Hyara house to survive and be reborn later would be a crushing blow against Shaitan and all his servants would feel his rage. As a final, crude attempt to save Mithrids life, the Lords fought against thirty darkfriends, a raging battle. Each Lord brought down eight darkfriends for his death, and one by one they fell from sword and knife strikes. When only two Lords survived to take the High Lord of the Hyaras towards Tar Valon.

He left the farm he had lived in and defended from evil since twelve because of this power. Mithrid had a solid idea in his mind to rebuild the Hyara house in its glory. As he ventured into Chachin again after ten years on that farm, almost everyone had forgotten about the Hyara house. Moving towards Arafel, his home, where people were sure to remember. When he arrived he was surprised by feuding of the houses in Arafel. Asking a few houses that the Hyara house had assisted once in a while brought frowns and loss of memory. Only a few remembered, and fewer helped. \nHe gathered only twenty people to help rebuild his house.

His parents trapped for furs and raised livestock for wool, milk and meat.  He has relatives in Shol Arbola who export into Shienar and occasionally make the longer trip to Tar Valon to exchange goods for profit.  He stays with them during the long winters and learns the business, writing and tallying, and he is given swords at twelve.  Summers, with spring and fall a short violent reckoning between warmth and cold, are spent herding and hiding and farming.  It is a welcome change, the faces and personalities of the city exchanged willingly for the simple adoration and stubbornness of animals, learning to reap and sow and something too of herbal lore.\nAt fifteen summers he is at his full height and beginning to lose the ranginess of a boy.  The fall of that year, he helps put down a man turned feral, his own kin but unrecognizable, inhuman and dangerous.  The act of kindness sickens him, but he can see the reason for it, at least.  Later he will wonder if it was less kindness and more fear, but it is years later.\nHe learns his family has spawned two of these in the last century, though until seeing the animal madness, he'd assumed the tales were nothing more than fanciful exaggeration of the temper afflicting many of his city relatives.\nWhen he is twenty, an Aes Sedai with a brown shawl tells his parents he must accompany her.  There is no promise he will be returned.  Evasion meets queries of why, but his mother tells him, when he travels home within two years, that they had suspected why, and she could not say how the Sedai would have known anything of their family, they are a private people, but Aes Sedai often know secret things.\nDuring his time with the Aes Sedai, he discovered some things about them, and he decides there is little reason to have taken him other than infernal curiosity.  It was a monumental waste of time, at his expense, and to his family's detriment.  His mother moves back into the city when the farm dwindles, and he thinks he will be helping in his relatives thriving business.\nIt is tedious work, and he does well at it, but there is no real place for him, everything he can do, another in the family can do and better.  He becomes withdrawn and disinterested.  He returns to Tar Valon and demands healing.  He is told the same thing as before he returned to Arafel, that they have already healed him.  Whatever health he has, he is as whole as the One Power can make him.  It is enough to make him believe the Three Oaths a political myth.\nFeeling cheated and wrecked, he retrieves gold with a note gifted him and adds it to pay he has saved from his work in Arafel.  It seems a fair amount until he puts his skills to use tallying expenses.  It might last him a year, if he did no work, in a city, much longer outside of the city, though living in an outlying town entailed varying degrees of labor, sometimes continuous, whether he wanted it or not.\nFor many reasons, instead of settling with his family in the borderland, instead of serving in the army of Arafel or Shienar, he begins traveling south for better fortune.  Away from a quiet Blight into a land newly furrowed by the heavy turning of the Wheel.  It should be interesting.  He feels he has not much to lose.\n

It is enough to make him believe the Three Oaths a political myth.\nFeeling cheated and wrecked, he retrieves gold with a note gifted him and adds it to pay he has saved from his work in Arafel.  It seems a fair amount until he puts his skills to use tallying expenses.  It might last him a year, if he did no work, in a city, much longer outside of the city, though living in an outlying town entailed varying degrees of labor, sometimes continuous, whether he wanted it or not.\nFor many reasons, instead of settling with his family in the borderland, instead of serving in the army of Arafel or Shienar, he begins traveling south for better fortune.  Away from a quiet Blight into a land newly furrowed by the heavy turning of the Wheel.  It should be interesting.  He feels he has not much to lose.\n

This is my bg.. I have my desc!  Let me know what I\nneed to do to get guilded, mmKay?\n \n   Tiaret was born on a spring morning to Roenal and Dahria \nRohan in Arad Doman. Her mother, Dahria was a tabac merchant\nwho traveled a great deal. Her father, Roenal, was a carpenter.\nHer mother traveled a great deal leaving her to be raised\nmostly by her father.\n   Her mother was not nearly as important of a figure in her\nlife as her father was, but she did do her motherly duties\nin teaching Tiaret the arts of the Domani woman. She took\na special interest in teaching her the many ways that Domani\nhave mastered of touching a man's face.\n   Tiaret lead a rather sheltered life, often spending her\ndays as a child near her father's workbench. She marveled\nat the way he created something from nothing, carving \nintricate pictures into the wood, making them appear as\nthough they were always there. \n   When she was six years old, she scampered off from her\nfather's workbench. So deep into his work, he did not\nnotice her gone for nearly an hour. When he did, he rushed\noff to find her but she was nowhere to be found. He and the\nfew servants that lived at the house searched well into the\nnight. It was only chance that one of the servants found\nher fallen down a well, nearly overcome with exhaustion\nand quietly whimpering for her father.\n   This caused a lifelong fear of the dark, mingled with\na great discomfort around water. She was always a brave\nlittle girl,  but she became much less adventurous after\nthis. She grew up daddy's little girl, although she had a\ngreat deal of her mother's manipulative streak. She always\nknew how to get her father to do exactly what she wanted\nhim to. \n   When she was fifteen years old, they held a Testing for\ngirls in the main plaza of Bander Eban. Tiaret and her\nfather were there shopping and she was quite excited by\nwhat was going on. When it was her turn, she beamed broadly\nat her father never expecting the path her new life would\ntake.\n   The smile that beamed so brightly the moment before\nshe found out that she had the spark was met by a dark frown \nfrom her father. She never realized that she would be forced\nto leave her family forever. Tiaret spent the entire trip\nto the Tower in tears. She stifled sobs during her interview\nwith the Mistress of Novices. But slowly, very slowly, she\nbecame accustomed to her new life in the Tower.\n   She threw herself into her lessons. When finally she\nbecame Accepted, she thrived by giving lessons to the Novices\nand blossomed when Aes Sedai praised her. She settled into\nher routine quite well. Quite well, that is until the day\nthe Tower split.\n   Tiaret was finishing up a Novice class when the fighting\nstarted. The older Accepted was uncertain of what to do, but\nshe led the gaggle of girls behind her through a back way to\nthe Novice quarters. She commanded them to stay, and then left\nthe Novice wing to see if she could find out what was going\non. It was during this time that she bumped into Jasmyne\nand Esrahd, who were fleeing the Tower. They took her with\nthem.\n   Tiaret followed Jasmyne along, learning and gathering\nwhat she could from the Yellow. They settled in Salidar for\na short time, but Jasmyne, Esrahd and Tiaret left the Little\nTower and headed towards Caemlyn. Jasmyne had plans for the\ngirl, and gained permission to take her with her as long\nas her studies were kept up.\n

It weakens the Light powers, the Asha'man and the Aes Sedai, which only gives the dark powers (like myself) more advantage when the Last Battle happens.

The last false dragon who could channel was Guaire \nAmalasan, who was gentled nearly sixty years before present day in the \nMUD.\nSolution D) Let your character begin play untrained in channeling.  \nThere's no realistic way to have any sort of tutoring on Saidin have \nbeen given to him before the start of the books.\n\nProblem E) Trollocs\nThere are no Trollocs in Caemlyn.

His father was a distant older man, but his mother a kind young woman, married to his father through an arrangement made by her peasant parents.  His father abused his young wife horribly, cursing her for a witch each time his paltry crop failed to grow or their only child failed to grow strongly enough.\n\nWhen Tristan was seven, his mother began a love affair with one of the two young stablehands that worked their farm.  She hungered for the love of a man who treated her well, and the two plotted to murder Tristan's father.  Unfortunately, their plans came for naught when the older man discovered them amking love when he returned early from a trip into Four Kings.\n\nHe murdered them both, slitting the farmhand's throat and beating his wife to death.  Tristan ran to the sound of his mother screaming as she was bludgeoned to death and cried as he watched her pass from this world at the hands of his maniac father.  In a rage, he turned on his young son, whipping him with his belt buckle.  The thrashing was so intense that at one point, the spike on the buckle sliced open the boy's left eye, leaving a long, thin scar from his forehead to the bottom of his cheek.  Not wanting anyone to know how it happened, Tristan's father left him to heal without assistance.  For half a year he was blind.  when he had blessedly regained his sight, his left eye had been drained of the brilliant hazel color of his right, and had turned a cold, pale blue.\n\nAfter that, his father trusted no one, forbade Tristan to mention his mother, and began drinking excessively.  For the next ten years, Tristan worked hard at the farm and rarely spoke.  When his father's drinking got too out of hand, he would beat the boy senseless with anything he could lay his gnarled hands on.  As Tristan grew to manhood, the beatings grew more frequent and more brutal.  The boy learned quickly never to speak, and over time he forgot his mother's name.  His father, when he spoke to him, he simply called 'Sir'.\n\nFinally about three months ago, Tristan, now grown to be a slightly emaciated but well-built young man driven half-mad with rage, anger, and ressentment, exacted his final revenge.  No longer content to wish for release from this endless nightmare through accident, he began to feel very heady and invinsible and decided on the spur of the moment to take matters into his own hands.  After a heavy night of drinking, his father, having exhausted himself hitting his only child with his fists, lay sprawled in the only chair near the fire.  Tristan retrieved some rope from the shed, tied his father tied and scattered firewood and oil throughout the room.\n\nHe left his father there, unconscious, as he threw what few things he had in a rough satchel.  Having taken everything he could - which was not much - the young man went back downstairs, punched his helpless father awake and spit in his face.  As the man tried to rise, Tristan sneered at him, his head swimming, and stepped casually to the door, cursing his father in his soft, unused voice.  His mismatched eyes looked cold death into his father's face as he picked up the oil lamp from the stand by the door and gave it a casual toss to the floor in front of the chair.\n\nTurning as the fire spread out, Tristan walked to the end of the path leading to the door without looking back.  When the screams of his father being immolated reached his ears, he started to laugh and cry simultaneously, completely heedless of his own emotional reaction.  He walked aimlessly through the countryside for some time before making his way almost two weeks later to Four Kings itself.  There he remained mostly unnoticed and stole what he could to eat or to replenish his ratty clothing.  Hearing rumors of the Dragon's army of male channelers outside Caemlyn, Tristan decided that he would see if he could harness his newfound freedom and power by learning to channel.\n\nHe set out straightaway and has been looking for the opportunity to find one of these fabled black-coated menaces.  He saw several on his arrival in Caemlyn, but always found that his unpracticed voice would be inadequate when dealing with the men, and his learned cowardice would always get the better of him before he could make himself speak to one.  He is slowly building up the mental and emotional strength to ask to be tested, accepted, taught, and one day soon, he will have it.\n\nDesc:\n`8Tristan stands at an unremarkable 5'6", made to seem shorter by his constant slouch.  This is not so much an issue of bad posture, but a seemingly inherent and intentional withdrawal from the humanity around him.

He looks like a typical farm boy\nwho has missed a few too many meals.\nThe only exception is his eyes.  His right eye is a `&briliant`8 and sparkling `3h`2a`7z`2e`3l`8 color, framed by eyelashes most women would kill for.

A long, thin `&s`7c`1a`7r`8 stretches from his forehead just above the center of that eye to the bottom of his strong cheekbone.

His shoes seem to be oversized as well, though more well-made than his other clothing should allow for.  On his back is slung a small, rough satchel.  He holds\ntight to the straps as if everything he owns is contained within.  By the looks of him, that might actually be the case.\n

Sunlight is warm at his back and a cool breeze touches his skin, muted where thin fabric shelters his torso from biting insects.  The breeze helps with that, confusing their delicate flight away from a determined path to his sweat and breath.  He might have seen nineteen summers, seven years old almost to the day, and he has all of his height and most of his weight.  In fact, it is not until much later that he loses muscle mass gained from farm work and training, and loses it rapidly at that.  Those things are far away from him now, his senses filled with quiet sounds punctuated by the sharp calls of birds and the occasional blare of nearby rodents' argument over resources.\n\nThe most remarkable aspect of the day --of which he is unaware at this moment-- is his complete and poignant lack of discomfort.  He slaps at a fly or gnat that has clung to his skin, more out of irritation than pain as he scarcely notices it.  There are other dangers here, the Blight reaching out under the land and through the waterways into the south, sometimes so far as his family's holdings.  His scent therefore is scrubbed away from him and replaced as well as possible with the smell of leafed and woody plants, dulled by clay and altered by fir.  Although his hair is braided, the bells on strands woven into it are silent, well-spaced and hollow decoration, present for tradition but non-functional.  In the city, he will have to redo the braids and replace the bells.\nIt is no great disturbance to him that while he walks the quiet forest, he is suddenly not just outside of his familial holdings but at the side of a road as he emerges from the woods, and if he had to guess a position, which he doesn't, he would say he was south of Shol Arbola and not too far away at that.  He takes the road toward the city, the sunlight bright and hot, and the flies thick as they converge to movement, darting away from piles of dung from many sorts of cart and pack animals.\nA wagon sits at the side of the road at a bend, both front wheels off, with a guard leaning against the back wheel as a woman in ornate clothing inspects the front axle.  There is nothing odd about this, to his mind, and as he approaches, he nods to Vance, who shrugs at him and gives him a mixed look of long suffering and tolerance both.  Telen says, "You're farther north than I expected you would be," and he isn't sure why he expected Vance to be south, but it is a good thing he caught him before going into the city.  He feels it is a good thing, though how Vance is here south of Shol Arbola with Brienne and Lierna, he could not say.  No, it isn't Lierna, it is Rienne straightening up from her inspection of the wagon's axle, with her inexpert wield of Domani wiles and sloppy execution of Light given graces.  Bloody hell.  He had been looking forward to seeing Lierna.  Resignation combines sickeningly with arousal.\nHe shrugs off the disappointment.  He is still looking forward to seeing her in the city.  Isn't he? He turns away from Rienne smiling at him to scan the woods and stare down the road toward the south.  Southeast.  No, no, she's here, somewhere.  For an instant, he knows he is dreaming and all his will twists at the fabric of it.  It is a fabric of woven bands of steel, flexible but noncompliant, and his will abrades and bleeds upon it.  Dreamscape resumes as if uninterrupted.  Bright sun beats down upon sandy hair and warms his shoulders.  Light pales the primary colors of noon with brightness, casting deep black shadows in pools below pines thickly carpeted in green grey needles.  \nWhat should remain memory is drawn out on silken threads and blends seamlessly with strands of possibility.  It is and it isn't Rienne's hand on his shoulder, one finger laid against the skin of his neck so that from between his shoulder blades to the nape of his neck all of the fine hairs are standing.  By the tingle of it, those at the nape of his neck are bristling as well.  He has walked the forest beside his family's house with only his long dagger and walked the road with a longsword at his hip, but when a dark shape wheels a shadow across the road, he is stepping forward away from warmth like a second sun and drawing twin blades from his back sheath.  His linen and wool are leathers, and there is thin metal plate reinforcing a cuirass and bracers laced to his chest and forearms.\nThe forest explodes with darkness, hoary and ragged shapes emerging from light and shadow as if the pools below the pines are rearing to shake ham fists, sprouting weapons and charging forward.  A cloud passes over the sun and the land becomes many shades of grey, the distinction between glowing highlight and velvet shadow blurring.  There is a tinny shriek, cut off.  He trusts that while he is facing the charge, Vance and Conar -Conar is here? he feels inappropriately exponential relief in the knowledge-are backing or flanking him and Rienne has retreated to the relative safety of the wagon.  Which might not be safe at all, if something else beside the young woman's hand stilled her foolish shriek.  He cannot think about it, he tells himself, but his heart is already constricting with dread.  A trolloc taller than the oxhead beast he saw in Tar Valon (his memory skips to encompass bits of events in the future, giving him the comparison neatly) bends its serrated beak down to slash at him, his reflexes dragging enough that the tip of it touches his chest and furrows fire across it through leather, snapping the cuirass and breaking the strap of his baldrick.\nTwin blades then snap forward, crossing as he stumbles back.  Time yawns and the ground cants beneath his soft leather boots.  Guttural roars and growling groans co-mingle.  The Trolloc's leather collar is slashed to expose beaten metal.  He did no damage to the beast at all.  Beside and somewhat behind him there is a wet crunch and thud amidst the shrill scream of metal sliding on metal, and another sound of impact, that of something large and yielding hitting something below it that is less so.  His next step backward meets a wagon wheel as the Dha'vol chortles and lunges again, though it is shouldered aside by a squatter beast with a wide spiky furred snout with a helm covering the exact distortion of its nature.  A cleaver the size of a small table sweeps out in a metal armored and clawed hand, and Telen drops to the ground and rolls, finding he is under the wagon, which has a rent through the center of it looking up into a charcoal sky.  At the edges of the tunnel view, an arm dangles, ribboned red.  It is yanked up and away bonelessly as he is rolling again to the other side of the wagon to face whatever carnage awaits.  Still living?\nAs he gains his feet, the wagon creaks and wood snaps staccato behind him.  He spins and backpedals, stepping around the corpse of a friend and watching wide-eyed as the wagon is lifted by two hulking forms and shook violently with as much ease as a dog might take a stick in wide jaws and shake it.  The whole thing comes toward him like the side of a barn, propelled by the combined strength of Trollocs' muscular fury.  He has time to try to dodge and then it hits him and carries him.  One foot drags through stunted grey grass before the trunk of a knotted tree meets his back and searing pain sends flames outward from the point of impact.  A split second later, the wagon pins him to it and he is blind for long seconds (though he can feel the positioning and shape of everything around him).  He can hear, through a distant roaring and oddly arrhythmic pounding, the straining wood of the tree creak and whine.  Or is it he that is whining?\nHis next breaths are shallow.  His vision returns and color with it as the sun appears weakly, a white glowing sphere that fades into a grey mass, leaching the red out of ichors running down the broken wood inches from his face.  Easier to not breathe.  Minutes pass and he can discern temperature difference within pain.  The sounds immediately apparent are not so easily deciphered.  Thick growls turn over rough tongues and the clack of a beak or tapping teeth form a crude language, most of the harsh sound emitted paces away from him.  A groan nearby and human restarts his slowing heart, and he tries to speak, fails, adding faint sound to the crunch of heavy booted feet and shod hooves and the manipulation of wood and metal and perhaps dead bodies.\n\nJust as he is thinking the city should send aid, he can smell smoke.  Not the rich aroma of cookfires and campfires but the thick oily stench of burning hair and lacquer and smoldering stained and painted woods.  Smoke from the fire of a city burning.  The groaning continues from inside the wagon.  He thinks it might be Brienne and each low sound of fear and pain suffuses him with adrenaline to combat agony enough for him to heave at the wagon, once, and be still, head spinning and sight blacking.\nHe waits.  His heartbeat slowly saturates all of the surrounding sound.  As sight returns, he turns his head to see the ichors black and drying on the scratched and glossy surface of coated boards.  A tremble from weakness or damage or some other cause increases to shaking throughout his frame.  He strains for the presence of mind to listen for signs of life other than bestial.  The wagon shifts away from him suddenly and he falls like a rag doll dropped by a disinterested child.  One of his legs is hooked deeply through the calf and a casual throwing motion sends his body across the ground to roll to a stop at clawed feet.\n

Time yawns and the ground cants beneath his soft leather boots.  Guttural roars and growling groans co-mingle.  The Trolloc's leather collar is slashed to expose beaten metal.  He did no damage to the beast at all.  Beside and somewhat behind him there is a wet crunch and thud amidst the shrill scream of metal sliding on metal, and another sound of impact, that of something large and yielding hitting something below it that is less so.  His next step backward meets a wagon wheel as the Dha'vol chortles and lunges again, though it is shouldered aside by a squatter beast with a wide spiky furred snout with a helm covering the exact distortion of its nature.  A cleaver the size of a small table sweeps out in a metal armored and clawed hand, and Telen drops to the ground and rolls, finding he is under the wagon, which has a rent through the center of it looking up into a charcoal sky.  At the edges of the tunnel view, an arm dangles, ribboned red.  It is yanked up and away bonelessly as he is rolling again to the other side of the wagon to face whatever carnage awaits.  Still living?\nAs he gains his feet, the wagon creaks and wood snaps staccato behind him.  He spins and backpedals, stepping around the corpse of a friend and watching wide-eyed as the wagon is lifted by two hulking forms and shook violently with as much ease as a dog might take a stick in wide jaws and shake it.  The whole thing comes toward him like the side of a barn, propelled by the combined strength of Trollocs' muscular fury.  He has time to try to dodge and then it hits him and carries him.  One foot drags through stunted grey grass before the trunk of a knotted tree meets his back and searing pain sends flames outward from the point of impact.  A split second later, the wagon pins him to it and he is blind for long seconds (though he can feel the positioning and shape of everything around him).  He can hear, through a distant roaring and oddly arrhythmic pounding, the straining wood of the tree creak and whine.  Or is it he that is whining?\nHis next breaths are shallow.  His vision returns and color with it as the sun appears weakly, a white glowing sphere that fades into a grey mass, leaching the red out of ichors running down the broken wood inches from his face.  Easier to not breathe.  Minutes pass and he can discern temperature difference within pain.  The sounds immediately apparent are not so easily deciphered.  Thick growls turn over rough tongues and the clack of a beak or tapping teeth form a crude language, most of the harsh sound emitted paces away from him.  A groan nearby and human restarts his slowing heart, and he tries to speak, fails, adding faint sound to the crunch of heavy booted feet and shod hooves and the manipulation of wood and metal and perhaps dead bodies.\n\nJust as he is thinking the city should send aid, he can smell smoke.  Not the rich aroma of cookfires and campfires but the thick oily stench of burning hair and lacquer and smoldering stained and painted woods.  Smoke from the fire of a city burning.  The groaning continues from inside the wagon.  He thinks it might be Brienne and each low sound of fear and pain suffuses him with adrenaline to combat agony enough for him to heave at the wagon, once, and be still, head spinning and sight blacking.\nHe waits.  His heartbeat slowly saturates all of the surrounding sound.  As sight returns, he turns his head to see the ichors black and drying on the scratched and glossy surface of coated boards.  A tremble from weakness or damage or some other cause increases to shaking throughout his frame.  He strains for the presence of mind to listen for signs of life other than bestial.  The wagon shifts away from him suddenly and he falls like a rag doll dropped by a disinterested child.  One of his legs is hooked deeply through the calf and a casual throwing motion sends his body across the ground to roll to a stop at clawed feet.\n

We agreed that, given events\nof the past few months (namely the Asha'man raid and the reunifi-\ncation of the White Tower), the best idea would be for the Tower\nto recover an item of great value that would somehow shift the\ndynamic of the relationship with the Black Tower. We brainstormed\nfor some time on what the item would be - whether it would be an\noffensive or defensive item, how powerful it would, the effects\nit would create. In the end, we agreed on a ter'angreal that would\nhave the effects of a Stedding, but only on men and their ability\nto grasp Saidin. The ter'angreal would affect the entire city of\nTar Valon, or if not that big an area, definitely the entire White\nTower and associated grounds. Realizing that this is an extremely\nimportant item in terms of affecting the RP between the White and\nBlack Towers, we decided that an extensive set of RP events would\nbe undertaken by the Tower GLs to recover this lost artifact. We\neven went so far as to develop the prelude to this event, a small\nset of passages that follow below that will kick the RP off at the\nWhite Tower and that will lead a group of Tower guildmembers into\nthe Blight in search of this ter'angreal. \n.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn exerpt of the passage discovered by Rosalyn Aes Sedai, a Brown \nSister studying the Tower histories for references to male channelers: \n".... the statue seems to have been carved by a master from the darkest \nobsidian. It depicts a forlorn man, blindfolded and bound in chains. \nHe hangs his head, an expression of despair carved on his features. \nThe statue reflects the light in odd ways. The shifting shadows on \nits surface make it appear the man is struggling against his bonds, \nthough of course, a statue cannot move. This was the account by \nTielle Notura of the White Ajah, advisor to Mabriam en Shareed, \nQueen of Aramaelle. Tielle Notura's account tells of the item \ncreating the same affect as the Ogier Stedding, a dampening of the \nability to sense the source, but strangely enough, that it only had \nthis affect on men and the male half of the True Source, Saidin. She \nmused that it was possibly created during the Breaking of the World \nto allow men to travel while still provided the sanctuary they sought \nat that time in Steddings, a defense against the madness of the time. \nIt may have been created at a later time, as an aid to capturing and \nprotecting those men who still roamed free." The passage continues, \ndescribing the parties that would be sent out to search for madmen, \nbut the statue is not mentioned again.\n.\nYet another passage is found, this one in a diary written by Stasi \nSedai, a Brown who lived around FY 150, a centuary and a half after \nthe end of the Trolloc Wars. She is relating her travels to the city \nof Jieranelle, in Rhamdashar, and describing some of the sights. She \nmentions an "odd statue of a man set on a table in the manor house \ncourtyard. The shadows played oddly about it. Unfortunately, I did \nnot have the time to study it properly. I only noticed it as the \ncaravan was pulling out. Perhaps I will be able to return soon and \ngive it the study it deserves. I did ask Rhodan about it, but he \nsaid he knew little about it, other than it had been in his family \nfor generations. He said it made him feel uneasy, and thought he \nmight one day sell it to someone else. I asked him to let me know if \nhe decided to be rid of it, as I would consider purchasing it myself." \nThe diary continues for many years, but the only other reference to \nthe statue is near the end. Stasi Sedai laments that she regrets never \nhaving gotten back to study the statue, and makes a note to herself to \nmention it to one of the younger Sedai to follow up.\n.\nRosalyn realized the magnitude of this discovery, of the potential \nsuch an item might have in the world today, with male channelers \nrunning free across the lands. Her continued research revealed that \nthe city of Jieranelle, in Rhamdashar, was located in what today is \nthe fallen nation of Malkier, in the Blight. Pouring over old maps \nand correlating it with new maps, she was able to determine the general \narea in Malkier where the city was located, but could not refine it any \nfurther.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n.\nFrom here, Rosalyn Sedai reports these finds to the Hall of the Tower,\nwho will form a committee to determine whether or not this holds enough\nmerit upon which they will base an exploratory expedition.

We agreed that, given events\nof the past few months (namely the Asha'man raid and the reunifi-\ncation of the White Tower), the best idea would be for the Tower\nto recover an item of great value that would somehow shift the\ndynamic of the relationship with the Black Tower. We brainstormed\nfor some time on what the item would be - whether it would be an\noffensive or defensive item, how powerful it would, the effects\nit would create. In the end, we agreed on a ter'angreal that would\nhave the effects of a Stedding, but only on men and their ability\nto grasp Saidin. The ter'angreal would affect the entire city of\nTar Valon, or if not that big an area, definitely the entire White\nTower and associated grounds. Realizing that this is an extremely\nimportant item in terms of affecting the RP between the White and\nBlack Towers, we decided that an extensive set of RP events would\nbe undertaken by the Tower GLs to recover this lost artifact. We\neven went so far as to develop the prelude to this event, a small\nset of passages that follow below that will kick the RP off at the\nWhite Tower and that will lead a group of Tower guildmembers into\nthe Blight in search of this ter'angreal. \n.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn exerpt of the passage discovered by Rosalyn Aes Sedai, a Brown \nSister studying the Tower histories for references to male channelers: \n".... the statue seems to have been carved by a master from the darkest \nobsidian. It depicts a forlorn man, blindfolded and bound in chains. \nHe hangs his head, an expression of despair carved on his features. \nThe statue reflects the light in odd ways. The shifting shadows on \nits surface make it appear the man is struggling against his bonds, \nthough of course, a statue cannot move. This was the account by \nTielle Notura of the White Ajah, advisor to Mabriam en Shareed, \nQueen of Aramaelle. Tielle Notura's account tells of the item \ncreating the same affect as the Ogier Stedding, a dampening of the \nability to sense the source, but strangely enough, that it only had \nthis affect on men and the male half of the True Source, Saidin. She \nmused that it was possibly created during the Breaking of the World \nto allow men to travel while still provided the sanctuary they sought \nat that time in Steddings, a defense against the madness of the time. \nIt may have been created at a later time, as an aid to capturing and \nprotecting those men who still roamed free." The passage continues, \ndescribing the parties that would be sent out to search for madmen, \nbut the statue is not mentioned again.\n.\nYet another passage is found, this one in a diary written by Stasi \nSedai, a Brown who lived around FY 150, a centuary and a half after \nthe end of the Trolloc Wars. She is relating her travels to the city \nof Jieranelle, in Rhamdashar, and describing some of the sights. She \nmentions an "odd statue of a man set on a table in the manor house \ncourtyard. The shadows played oddly about it. Unfortunately, I did \nnot have the time to study it properly. I only noticed it as the \ncaravan was pulling out. Perhaps I will be able to return soon and \ngive it the study it deserves. I did ask Rhodan about it, but he \nsaid he knew little about it, other than it had been in his family \nfor generations.

There are several small clusters of `3wooden`7 chairs around low tables scattered about the room, apparently set up as places to talk business with the mercenaries of `#H`3eron `8Company`7. A stairway leads from the front of the building up to the second floor at the east side of the room, with another door beneath the stairs leading to the Dining Room. The lone doorway on the west side of the room leads to the Training Room.\n\n`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Dining Room`7 (public, Meeting Room to West, Kitchens to North)\n`7This long, low room has a series of `3d`8a`2r`8k `2w`8o`2o`8d`7 tables with benches running alongside. A few round `3tables`7 circled by chairs fill up the empty space along the west wall, and a wide `1f`!i`7r`1e`!p`7l`1a`!c`7e rests at the north end of the room, alongside a door to the kitchens. The door back to the Meeting Room lies on the west wall.\n\n`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Kitchens`7 (public, Dining Room to South, Stables to North)\n`7S`8t`&o`7n`8e`7 ovens and heavy `8i`7r`8o`7n stoves line this room, making it warm no matter what time of year it is. By the equipment, smells, and the small amount of food visible when the cooks aren't working, the fare made here tends towards good and solid, with little flare or fancy doings. The door to the south leads into the Dining Room, and another door on the north side of the room leads outside to the Stableyard.\n\n`&The Stables of `#H`3eron `#H`3all`7 (public, Kitchen to South)\n`7Behind the three-story building that serves as the headquarters of `#H`3eron `8Company`7 lies an open stableyard almost the same size. A large stable juts off from the main building like the arm of an 'L,' holding the horses of `#H`3eron `8Company`7 in small but comfortable stalls. One can often see small units of mercenaries drilling with pikes or spears in the open space between the stable and the barracks.\n\n`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Training Room`7 (public, Meeting Room to East)\n`7This room takes up the majority of the first floor of the building. A few `3wooden`7 pillars are scattered around to support the upper floors, but otherwise the room is completely open. `&C`3a`7n`&v`7a`&s`7 covers the floor, with `!r`1e`!d`7 circles painted on it, and racks of `3lathes`7 and other `&w`7e`&a`7p`&o`7n`&s`7 line the walls. There is a `1f`!i`7r`1e`!p`7l`1a`!c`7e along the west wall to take some of the chill off, but it seems to be rarely used, given how often there are mercenaries practicing their livelihood in the room. There is an ostentatiously large `&lo`7ok`8ing g`7la`&ss`7 along one wall, for practicing forms in front of. The door back to the Meeting Room is in the east wall.\n\n2nd Floor:\n`&The Second Floor Hallway`7 (public, Barracks to West, File Leader's Room to South, Volante's room to East, Telen's room to North, Meeting Room to Down, Third Floor Landing to Up)\n`7This hallway connects the stairs at the front of the building that lead down to the first floor with the ones at the back of the building that lead up to the top floor.

There are several small clusters of `3wooden`7 chairs around low tables scattered about the room, apparently set up as places to talk business with the mercenaries of `#H`3eron `8Company`7. A stairway leads from the front of the building up to the second floor at the east side of the room, with another door beneath the stairs leading to the Dining Room. The lone doorway on the west side of the room leads to the Training Room.\n\n`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Dining Room`7 (public, Meeting Room to West, Kitchens to North)\n`7This long, low room has a series of `3d`8a`2r`8k `2w`8o`2o`8d`7 tables with benches running alongside. A few round `3tables`7 circled by chairs fill up the empty space along the west wall, and a wide `1f`!i`7r`1e`!p`7l`1a`!c`7e rests at the north end of the room, alongside a door to the kitchens. The door back to the Meeting Room lies on the west wall.\n\n`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Kitchens`7 (public, Dining Room to South, Stables to North)\n`7S`8t`&o`7n`8e`7 ovens and heavy `8i`7r`8o`7n stoves line this room, making it warm no matter what time of year it is. By the equipment, smells, and the small amount of food visible when the cooks aren't working, the fare made here tends towards good and solid, with little flare or fancy doings. The door to the south leads into the Dining Room, and another door on the north side of the room leads outside to the Stableyard.\n\n`&The Stables of `#H`3eron `#H`3all`7 (public, Kitchen to South)\n`7Behind the three-story building that serves as the headquarters of `#H`3eron `8Company`7 lies an open stableyard almost the same size. A large stable juts off from the main building like the arm of an 'L,' holding the horses of `#H`3eron `8Company`7 in small but comfortable stalls. One can often see small units of mercenaries drilling with pikes or spears in the open space between the stable and the barracks.\n\n`&The `#H`3eron `#H`3all`& Training Room`7 (public, Meeting Room to East)\n`7This room takes up the majority of the first floor of the building. A few `3wooden`7 pillars are scattered around to support the upper floors, but otherwise the room is completely open. `&C`3a`7n`&v`7a`&s`7 covers the floor, with `!r`1e`!d`7 circles painted on it, and racks of `3lathes`7 and other `&w`7e`&a`7p`&o`7n`&s`7 line the walls. There is a `1f`!i`7r`1e`!p`7l`1a`!c`7e along the west wall to take some of the chill off, but it seems to be rarely used, given how often there are mercenaries practicing their livelihood in the room. There is an ostentatiously large `&lo`7ok`8ing g`7la`&ss`7 along one wall, for practicing forms in front of. The door back to the Meeting Room is in the east wall.\n\n2nd Floor:\n`&The Second Floor Hallway`7 (public, Barracks to West, File Leader's Room to South, Volante's room to East, Telen's room to North, Meeting Room to Down, Third Floor Landing to Up)\n`7This hallway connects the stairs at the front of the building that lead down to the first floor with the ones at the back of the building that lead up to the top floor.

When I first created, I did not choose channeling, and then I re-created with some ability.\nTelen was born in southern Arafel outside of a small town by a swift running river.  His parents trapped for furs and raised livestock for wool, milk and meat.  He has relatives in Shol Arbola who export into Shienar and occasionally make the longer trip to Tar Valon to exchange goods for profit.  He stays with them during the long winters and learns the business, writing and tallying.  He is gifted swords at twelve.  Summers, with spring and fall a short violent reckoning between warmth and cold, are spent herding and hiding and farming.  It is a welcome change, the faces and personalities of the city exchanged willingly for the simple adoration and stubbornness of animals, learning to reap and sow and something too of herbal lore.\nAt fifteen summers he is at his full height and beginning to lose the ranginess of a boy.  The fall of that year, he helps put down a man turned feral, his own kin but unrecognizable, nearly inhuman, and dangerous.  The act of kindness sickens him, but he can see the reason for it, at least.  Later he will wonder if it was less kindness and more fear, but it is years later.\nHe learns his family has spawned two of these in the last century, though until seeing the animal madness, he'd assumed the tales were nothing more than fanciful exaggeration of the temper afflicting many of his city relatives.\nWhen he is twenty, an Aes Sedai with a brown shawl tells his parents he must accompany her.  There is no promise he will be returned.  Evasion meets queries of why, but his mother tells him, when he travels home within two years, that they had suspected why, and she could not say how the Sedai would have known anything of their family, they are a private people, but Aes Sedai often know secret things.\nDuring his time with the Aes Sedai, there is little time where he is not occupied with training of one sort or another.  It may be that he would have continued to train with the Tower guard and some few of the Gaidin and remained a servant of the White Tower.  After nearly two years, he is performing chores for an Aes Sedai outside of the Brown's study.  His memory of exact events is unclear.  He does recall being told that if he had done what he was told and no more or less, he should have suffered no ill.  There had been a few instances of curiosity costing him, easily remedied, and he accepts his fault.  Aes Sedai do not lie, he must have done.  It is after he is told he cannot be Healed that the weight of tragedy hits him.  He is released from the study and given notes for coin to cover difficulty in making a living.  He believes it is also for his silence, though that is never demanded.  It might have been said in so many words.\nHis mother moves back into the city when the farm dwindles, and when he arrives in Arafel, he will be helping in his relatives' thriving business.  It is tedious work, and he does well at it, but there is no real place for him, everything he can do, another in the family can do and better.  He becomes withdrawn and disinterested.\nFeeling cheated and wrecked, he retrieves gold with a note gifted him and adds it to pay he has saved from his work in Arafel.  It seems a fair amount until he puts his skills to use tallying expenses.  It might last him a year, if he did no work, in a city, much longer outside of the city, though living in an outlying town entailed varying degrees of labor, sometimes continuous, whether he wanted it or not.\nFor many reasons, instead of settling with his family in the borderland, instead of serving in the army of Arafel or Shienar, he begins traveling south for better fortune.  Away from a quiet Blight into a land newly furrowed by the heavy turning of the Wheel.  It should be interesting.  He feels he has not much to lose.\n

His parents own and operate a small, self-sufficient farm just southeast of Tar Valon along with his father's two brothers and their small families.  He was raised by all the adults and taught the values of hard work, politeness, and discipline, and never disallowed from having fun when it was warranted.  Basically, he lived a fairly ideal life.\n\nWhen he was twelve, he was helping his uncle hook up an oxcart when something spooked the oxen in the pen and caused a small, short stampede that was easily smoothed over.  In the rush of the initial panic, though, the boy was knocked over and his left forearm caught under the hooves of one of the frightened giants, crushing it instantly.  His uncle wrapped a tourinquet above the elbow and hoisted the boy up to the drive. Without delay, he was rushed to the Tower, a scant and interminable couple hours away from the farm.  He thankfully passed out from the pain shortly after the ride began, and woke up upon the cold shock of Healing.  Unfortunately, thanks to the complete shattering of the bones and crushing of muscle in his forearm, combined with the cut off of blood and subsequent deadening of the tissue from the tourinquet, everything below the left elbow had to come off.\n\nIt was a freak accident that no one could have prevented or helped, and Julian bore up to it well.  Since it was Healed, he felt no pain once the Aes Sedai let him go, and he merely went back to being a boy on the verge of manhood.  His parents, however, became quite cautious and turned slightly overprotective of their middle child.  Never actually stifling him, they nevertheless cut him off, perhaps without even meaning to, from many things they would never before have bat an eye at.  He had to sneak work in, as they tried to keep him away from the fields: he had to trade favors with his brother to go chop wood instead of stay in the house (his brother always encouraged him to push himself, but would rarely let him do so without his watchful eye).  Well-meaning, his parents did keep him back somewhat, always just a little too worried about their young son.\n\nA friendly and outgoing sort, Julian was rarely without company or good times, but even his friends seemed not completely sure how to deal with his injury.  For his part, Julian just lived his life the way he had always intended to, never letting his half-arm slow him down and learning to get around the limitations his deformity set for him.  He dreamed of doing something worthwhile, to prove to himself and everyone else that he was no less a man, even though he was less of a man now than he should have been - at least physically.\n\nAfter the recent news of the attack on the Tower, the crystalline obelisk that had been a constant presence in his life for all of his time on earth, he decided this was his chance.  With the grudging support of his older brother, he shared his new dream to be a Tower Guardsman with his family, who could do nothing to stop him, but tried mightily anyway.  Their pity, their pleas, their arguments all fell on deaf ears and were blocked by his indomitable will, a trait his family had seen fit to instill in him and which they now were coming to regret.  So, he packed up, took a little money, and moved off into the Shining City to seek a simple destiny of worth and responsibility.\n\nDesc:\n\nThis young man stands maybe an inch over average height and\nhis build is perhaps slightly broader than that of most men\naround his age, probably late teens or early twenties.  He\nhas short, wavy hair that is light brown in color with just\na hint of coppery highlights that can only be seen in the right\nlight.  His eyes have a greenish-hazel hue, though much like\nhis hair, they can seem to shift color slightly depending on\nthe ambient light or the color clothes he happens to be wearing.\nIt looks as though the man is used to smiling, even when he is\nnot actively doing so, and when he does, he reveals slightly\ncrooked white teeth.\n\nGenerally fit and trim, there is one feature that stands out\nabove all the others.  His left arm is half as long as his\nright, having nothing past the elbow.  Whether he wears a jacket\nor not, the malformed arm is always covered in a long sleeve,\ncrisply folded and pinned up to hide the end of his stump.\nNothing about the way he moves or interacts with others indicates\nthe deformity is a hindrance to him, but it is impossible to miss.\n\nHe dresses most often in clean if simple work pants and a shirt,\nusually covered by a jacket for propriety's sake.  His feet are\ncovered by well-worn black leather boots with hardened soles and\ntoes, perfect for general labor.  Tucked into the back waistline\nof his pants is a long knife, good for just about any purpose a\nshort blade might be put to.

Since 1994, our coders and \nbuilders have been working hard to bring in unique new \nfeatures and our own original areas.  MiT is currently on \nour second major revision of the codebase, and our areas \nare all completely original.  At A Moment in Tyme, we have \na dedicated playerbase and an excellent, committed staff of \nImmortals.  We have unique systems in place to rank \nplayers' mastery in swordplay and channeling (Wheel of \nTime's magic system).\n \nA Moment in Tyme is set on a Timeline that is based on the\nfirst six books. After that, though, Tyme has broken away\nto become a mirror world of the books. The Bowl of the Winds\nhas been found and used, breaking the long winter. Elayne\nhas returned to Andor and taken the Throne. After a long\nstruggle, Analinde su Riaten Rie now controls Cairhien\nwith Rand al'Thor's, the Dragon Reborn, approval. \n \nThe White Tower has split, but after a Black Tower raid \nagainst the Aes Sedai, Elaida has been kidnapped and now \nawaits trial before the newly reunified Tower. Who will be\nAmyrlin now? Already several woman are seeking the title.\n \nAnd the Seanchan? Tarabon, Arad Doman, and Altara are\nall victims of the Ever Victorious Army. The High Lady\nSuroth invaded, and conquered Murandy, instead of reaching\ninto Amadicia. Because of this, High Lady Ilorin Shayndel \nPaendrag, fourth in line for the Crystal Throne, has \nofficially settled into the Panarch's Palace and taken\ncontrol of the Hailene. Who will stop them? Word is that \na mercenary group called the Heron Company is being raised\nto retake Arad Doman...\n \nA Moment in Tyme is a RP-intensive MUD. We have an RPexp\nsystem which rewards RP by giving EXP based on emotes. \nCombat Code is currently offline, as it is being completely\nremodified and built from the ground up. It will utilize\n50 different body parts as well as have very realistically\ncoded forms with special procedures. \n

It may be that he would have continued to train with the Tower guard and some few of the Gaidin and remained a servant of the White Tower.  After nearly two years, he is performing chores for an Aes Sedai outside of the Brown's study.  His memory of exact events is unclear.  He does recall being told that if he had done what he was told and no more or less, he should have suffered no ill.  There had been a few instances of curiosity costing him, easily remedied, and he accepts his fault.  Aes Sedai do not lie, he must have done.  It is after he is told he cannot be Healed that the weight of tragedy hits him.  He is released from the study and given notes for coin to cover difficulty in making a living.  He believes it is also for his silence, though that is never demanded.  It might have been said in so many words.\nHis mother moves back into the city when the farm dwindles, and when he arrives in Arafel, he will be helping in his relatives' thriving business.  It is tedious work, and he does well at it, but there is no real place for him, everything he can do, another in the family can do and better.  He becomes withdrawn and disinterested.\nFeeling cheated and wrecked, he retrieves gold with a note gifted him and adds it to pay he has saved from his work in Arafel.  It seems a fair amount until he puts his skills to use tallying expenses.  It might last him a year, if he did no work, in a city, much longer outside of the city, though living in an outlying town entailed varying degrees of labor, sometimes continuous, whether he wanted it or not.\nFor many reasons, instead of settling with his family in the borderland, instead of serving in the army of Arafel or Shienar, he begins traveling south for better fortune.  Away from a quiet Blight into a land newly furrowed by the heavy turning of the Wheel.  It should be interesting.  He feels he has not much to lose.\n

I've played 3 Warder/TG characters before this one. On Dragon's Fang, I played the same character for over 4 RL years before the MUD transferred, and I went to Iraq. \nHis background:\nDarien al'Shain was born to Leorin and Mikel al'Shain in a large town half a day's ride from Maradon in Saldaea. Shortly after conception, his parents migrated north from Andor. He grew up quite happy, with a younger brother and sister. His father started in the army, and for courage and valor in battle was granted a tract of land and a minor title(Nothing more than a knight, really) from the Queen. As a young boy, he was prenticed to his uncle in Maradon, learning the trade of blacksmithing. However, as young men go, he hungered for more adventure, and having heard rumors of the split in the White Tower, he set off south to see what he could learn.\nHe eventually fell in with the Rebel Tower, and with them not being willing to let him go, he entered into their training program, quickly distinguishing himself as an excellent student. Trained in stealth and guerilla maneuvers due to the forested terrain, as well as bowmanship, swordsmanship, and the use of a staff, he was a model student, for a time.\nAfter a Shadowspawn attack on Salidar, in which he managed to save his Instructor's life from a Fade, he set upon the idea that though the Aes Sedai were planning their offensive, they were poorly informed. He set out from Caemlyn while there one day recruiting, and made his way to Tar Valon, playing at being a defector to their cause, but in truth, hiding his nature, that of being a spy. Not even close to being a covert op, those in Salidar did truly think him a defector. He did what he could, recording information and learning everything he could, still continuing his training in the process. Upon receiving his promotion to Gaidin, he felt he could do no more, and returned to Salidar, with a warrant out in Tar Valon for his arrest.\nUpon his return, few believed him at first, and he had to go through the process of proving himself again, while avoiding a particularly insistent Gaidin intent on having him tried as a traitor to the Rebels. During the period after he returned, he met his first and only Bond that he would ever carry, a tried and proven Green named Lio Ezara(Same one from here). They were an inseperable team, for years, until she felt compelled to release him from his Bond for personal reasons. He took on the role of scout and Instructor in Salidar, and remained that way for a couple years until Lio reappeared in his life, and Bonded him once more.\n\nAfter that, it's all pretty mundane stuff, because the MUD had started to die, and everyone switched here or elsewhere.\n\nThe syllabus on the MUD was quite similar to the one here, though they focused on the different points at different times in training. Tracking, stealth, unarmed combat as well as secondary and tertiary weapons training, the Flame and Void. Also included were lessons on the Nature of the One Power in relation to their Aes Sedai, the Dangers of the One Power, Nature of the Bond, Tactics and strategy classes, Mounted combat, endless spars. Also, I dunno if it's relevant, but I had started the process on Fang of attaining Blademaster status. \n\nWell, if there's anything else you need, let me know.\n\nDarien\n

I would bar my door from the inside, and that seemed to work well enough."  'Well enough' has the same kind subtle irony in it as 'May the Creator shelter you'.  Like a tar patch on a bucket of coals, or a block of ice set out in the sun to weight a stack of hides.  Sure, that, kind of works.

A bit of paste for your face hardly seems worth complaining about, I cannot believe I did it."  The comment gathers weariness and discards it for self-recrimination.  "I can show you how to wake me, but still, there is that, that it might have to be done."  He remembers now he had suggestions on how this might be less of a problem.  They sound incredibly dumb to him now, in retrospect.  It is only what he did in his travel from Arafel to Caemlyn.  Yes, incredibly dumb.  He is lucky he didn't break his neck falling out of a tree.  "If you would like me to find my own way to Bandar Eban, I will do that.  If I am going with you, I need to show you, and the lady Duriel, some few things before we arrive."  Though not necessarily before they leave.

The faint ruddiness of sunburn has faded to dull tan, but he removes a jar of oil from one of the few tins he has squirreled, pours a bit out into his palm and rubs it into his skin so that, he hopes, the skin will darken and not peel.

Wasting no time, and thinking nothing of it, he unbinds the ends and unbraids the hair.  It does not have much color in it to his mind.  Like sodden, earthy straw.  He supposes one might call it a medium brown, though the color is odd, he thinks there might be shades of green in it.  Grimacing, he slips his knife from its sheathe at his belt and gathers his hair at the nape of his neck, twists it, places the edge of the knife against the thick column, the spine at his neck, and saws outward.  The hairs part easily but the process takes much longer than he expects.  Loose hair falls forward slowly in a fan, tickling skin.\nHours later, after supper when the evening stretches shadows out from every corner, Telen makes use of a mirror at the end of the upstairs hall of the inn before going into his room.  It is a small mirror, and the frame looks as though it has been secured well to the wood paneled wall.  The silver reflects his image back to him half draped in shadow, but he stares at it, repressing an urge to look behind him.  It isn't Telen, which is good.  The man staring back at him has shoulder length curling hair of some medium color.  It could be dark blond.  His eyes appear pale also, even in the poor lighting.  His skin has an obviously new tan, but he hardly notices such things.  The hair is an unruly mane and he runs both hands through it, bewilderment in wide eyes.  His uneven trimming is hidden by a mass of curl.  Where it all came from, he has no idea.  It was straight before he cut it, and it was straight when he looked at it after he cut it.  It must go.

He is not sure what he will do with the clippings.  Leave it in the forest maybe for birds and mice to scavenge for nests.  It felt strange coiled in his hands, like a small, sleek furred animal, warming quickly within his hold.  Hard to describe how he felt without hair that, unbraided, hung below his waist, except lighter somehow.  Somehow being different than literally, lighter, and less impeded with movement of his head and neck.  The town must have a barber or seamstress who would shave his head.

We agreed that, given events\nof the past few months (namely the Asha'man raid and the reunifi-\ncation of the White Tower), the best idea would be for the Tower\nto recover an item of great value that would somehow shift the\ndynamic of the relationship with the Black Tower. We brainstormed\nfor some time on what the item would be - whether it would be an\noffensive or defensive item, how powerful it would, the effects\nit would create. In the end, we agreed on a ter'angreal that would\nhave the effects of a Stedding, but only on men and their ability\nto grasp Saidin. The ter'angreal would affect the entire city of\nTar Valon, or if not that big an area, definitely the entire White\nTower and associated grounds. Realizing that this is an extremely\nimportant item in terms of affecting the RP between the White and\nBlack Towers, we decided that an extensive set of RP events would\nbe undertaken by the Tower GLs to recover this lost artifact. We\neven went so far as to develop the prelude to this event, a small\nset of passages that follow below that will kick the RP off at the\nWhite Tower and that will lead a group of Tower guildmembers into\nthe Blight in search of this ter'angreal. \n.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn exerpt of the passage discovered by Rosalyn Aes Sedai, a Brown \nSister studying the Tower histories for references to male channelers: \n".... the statue seems to have been carved by a master from the darkest \nobsidian. It depicts a forlorn man, blindfolded and bound in chains. \nHe hangs his head, an expression of despair carved on his features. \nThe statue reflects the light in odd ways. The shifting shadows on \nits surface make it appear the man is struggling against his bonds, \nthough of course, a statue cannot move. This was the account by \nTielle Notura of the White Ajah, advisor to Mabriam en Shareed, \nQueen of Aramaelle. Tielle Notura's account tells of the item \ncreating the same affect as the Ogier Stedding, a dampening of the \nability to sense the source, but strangely enough, that it only had \nthis affect on men and the male half of the True Source, Saidin. She \nmused that it was possibly created during the Breaking of the World \nto allow men to travel while still provided the sanctuary they sought \nat that time in Steddings, a defense against the madness of the time. \nIt may have been created at a later time, as an aid to capturing and \nprotecting those men who still roamed free." The passage continues, \ndescribing the parties that would be sent out to search for madmen, \nbut the statue is not mentioned again.\n.\nYet another passage is found, this one in a diary written by Stasi \nSedai, a Brown who lived around FY 150, a centuary and a half after \nthe end of the Trolloc Wars. She is relating her travels to the city \nof Jieranelle, in Rhamdashar, and describing some of the sights. She \nmentions an "odd statue of a man set on a table in the manor house \ncourtyard. The shadows played oddly about it. Unfortunately, I did \nnot have the time to study it properly. I only noticed it as the \ncaravan was pulling out. Perhaps I will be able to return soon and \ngive it the study it deserves. I did ask Rhodan about it, but he \nsaid he knew little about it, other than it had been in his family \nfor generations. He said it made him feel uneasy, and thought he \nmight one day sell it to someone else. I asked him to let me know if \nhe decided to be rid of it, as I would consider purchasing it myself." \nThe diary continues for many years, but the only other reference to \nthe statue is near the end. Stasi Sedai laments that she regrets never \nhaving gotten back to study the statue, and makes a note to herself to \nmention it to one of the younger Sedai to follow up.\n.\nRosalyn realized the magnitude of this discovery, of the potential \nsuch an item might have in the world today, with male channelers \nrunning free across the lands. Her continued research revealed that \nthe city of Jieranelle, in Rhamdashar, was located in what today is \nthe fallen nation of Malkier, in the Blight. Pouring over old maps \nand correlating it with new maps, she was able to determine the general \narea in Malkier where the city was located, but could not refine it any \nfurther.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n.\nFrom here, Rosalyn Sedai reports these finds to the Hall of the Tower,\nwho will form a committee to determine whether or not this holds enough\nmerit upon which they will base an exploratory expedition. It is here\nthat the RP events will kick-off. I fully expect at least a dozen events\n(and much likely more), with small RP between guildmembers and even\noutside of the guild spawning as a result.\n.\nMaelyn and I feel that the item we've proposed is significant enough\nto warrant a major RP event as this, but that it will also not shift\nthe balance enough to majorly impact RP on the mud. It also would be\na major reward for the White Tower, which would effectively by protected\nagainst male channelers as long as the statue was in the White Tower.\n.\nPlease reply to me with comments. I am spearheading the effort to get\nthis RP event going and will be putting some major time in when I get\nback from Mexico to organize and kick things off. Basically, I believe\nthat I need buy-in from all of the Imms I've sent this to in order for\nit to be a successful event, so please consider this carefully and\nlet us know as soon as you can so that we can move forward.\n.\nOn behalf of Maelyn and myself, thanks.\n.\nRegards,\nBalinor\n

He whines and the sound impresses upon him the need for silence.  He removes wet clothing and allows his skin to dry as he works.  The body laid out on the dark floorboards is still warm, eerily so.  He strips the corpse and folds the clothing small enough to stuff into the man's undershirt, making of it a small bolster.  He might be able to use the boots.  Taking a shuddering breath, he tucks a finger under the window's dingy curtain and shifts it so that he can see out, except that, after moving the curtain, all he can see is what he believes must be years of oily grime cemented with dust on rippled glass.  It allows enough light in the small room to tell the time by, though with no real precision.\nOther than the one time in Illian where he was poisoned by bad food, he has been hale and so far escaped serious injury.  Even during those two brawls.  The bruises healed fast, and nothing broke, so far as he could tell.  He stills an urge to run a hand over the velvet on the top of his head, a habit now.  He supposes, when he thinks about it and wishes not to do it, that he likes the feel of it as the hair starts growing back in.  A dry swallow reminds him he has eaten only enough to prevent his stomach from cramping with hunger.\nThe corpse was once a young man, though that young man was unkept and aged by what one assumes was a harsh life.  His teeth are dull streaked orange like mushroom paste and sported fairly large gaps where some were missing, knocked out or rotted out.  The man's hair is black and short, raggedly cut and before he died had been tucked under a stiff scarf dyed or stained red black.  The cool humid air does not bother him, but the corpse and its clothing reeks of all that is vile.  The shore is a short distance southeast.  There is no water in the shack, no clean cloth, no soap nor any other usable amenity.  Two sides of the building form part of narrow alleys, another is nearly abutting a similar shack, probably empty but it is hard to tell.  The air without is full of small sounds, waves moving the docks, moving against the docks, ropes creaking, wood protesting as it is strained and shifted.  Shore and sea birds in abundance cry as they wheel and dive, though while he was outside he could not hear voice of man or bird except in the distance.\nHe had thought to find work for a day or two and absorb information borne by dockworkers, fishermen and other tradesmen near the shore.  Not that he would be able to remember it all, nor would it be as much as he feels he needs to know, but it would be something.  It would be more than he knows now.  He would like to know a little less right now, too.  No reason for the man to follow him, unless instructed by those who had given Telen direction earlier, and he supposes it makes sense they would have.  Telen is dressed well by comparison and the clothing is clean.  His fastidious habits have not degraded so much that he does not wash his clothing.  Exceptionally displeased with that thought -that maybe he should not wash his clothing so often--, he scowls and considers his situation.  A dead man and his clothing, likely a cutpurse but possibly worse, certainly a man willing to do violence.  And Telen unscathed but without clothing, all hidden for the moment in an abandoned shack.\nNot entirely unscathed, he thinks as he twists to look at his sides and the back of his legs.  There is a sore spot on one shoulder and scrapes and light bruising along his shins, and one hand is stiff and the wrist swollen.  He is only just noticing it, though he does remember fumbling with the one hand and then favoring it.\nTelen stops thinking about reasons.  The man is dead.  What he needs to do is wash his clothing and find a new inn, leaving the body to decay and be devoured by creeping things.  An ignoble end, fitting to the man's short and ignoble life.  He shrugs.  It is either that or drag it to the shore, weight it down and drop it in the water.  He runs his nails across his skin, flaking off residue where liquid soaked through and smeared across his chest and arms.  The rest of his body is inspected and similarly cleansed.  He dons his trousers, dark enough to hide most of the spatter, and slides his sheathed knife into a long pocket.  The entire length does not fit, but it will probably stay put.  His belt is ruined and he balls the rest of his own clothing with the dead man's and buckles the belt around it.  The neat ball goes into the water on his roundabout way back into the city.\nFor an annoyingly tense moment, the ball bobs on the surface of the dark water, though heavily and, feeling exposed and vulnerable silhouetted against a grey sky, he has to watch it to make sure it does sink.  It does.  Wearing only the boots and trousers, he finds a back way into his inn and climbs three sets of narrow stairs to his room.  The day's events crash down and cover him like a landslide and for long minutes, he sits in the center of his room on the floor bowed down, elbows on knees, head in hands.\nThere is some comfort in the stillness and quiet, and after sitting long enough for his muscles to begin to protest, he unfolds and stands, locks his door and washes with tepid water from a ceramic basin on the floor by his bed.  It is a cheap room, and there is only the basin and the thin mattress on a rough legged frame, and one window that opens and can be shuttered and latched tight from the inside.  He leaves it open.  He has paid for the room for two days and leaving will not attract untoward attention.  So his few days in the city have drained his resources doubly, as he will again rent a room at a new inn for more than a day, and he does not plan to stay past a night.\nHis new room has lice in it.  Or, specifically, the mattress has lice in it.  In a fit of peeve, he powders it and pounds the lumpy cloth, certain he is crushing as many insects as the powder poisons.  He will not wake covered in sores and bites in the morning.  He realizes the attitude must change, but cannot do it yet.  Tomorrow, after he's eaten, he will better deal with what is left of his integrity.  He might even be able to laugh at the pain.\nA small, wobbly table is lifted and set next to the low bed.  An impulse to disassemble the table and reseat the joints is ignored for the second time.  He sits on the bed and draws his legs up to tuck under his knees.  All of his possessions fit into a small trunk, strapped for hauling, and a large satchel, which is open and the canvas pulled down to reveal the contents jammed into the wide mouth.  He should write a note to those in Caemlyn, though he has nothing much to say.  It is only preparation for things to come, but necessary.  He should write a letter to Lierna, telling her -everything he is thinking.  Though maybe less of what he is feeling.  Has he not said that, already? Better to leave her alone, and let what he expects will happen, to happen.  This will only take time, and time will pass, whether he wills it or no.\n

He strips the corpse and folds the clothing small enough to stuff into the man's undershirt, making of it a small bolster.  He might be able to use the boots.  Taking a shuddering breath, he tucks a finger under the window's dingy curtain and shifts it so that he can see out, except that, after moving the curtain, all he can see is what he believes must be years of oily grime cemented with dust on rippled glass.  It allows enough light in the small room to tell the time by, though with no real precision.\nOther than the one time in Illian where he was poisoned by bad food, he has been hale and so far escaped serious injury.  Even during those two brawls.  The bruises healed fast, and nothing broke, so far as he could tell.  He stills an urge to run a hand over the velvet on the top of his head, a habit now.  He supposes, when he thinks about it and wishes not to do it, that he likes the feel of it as the hair starts growing back in.  A dry swallow reminds him he has eaten only enough to prevent his stomach from cramping with hunger.\nThe corpse was once a young man, though that young man was unkept and aged by what one assumes was a harsh life.  His teeth are dull streaked orange like mushroom paste and sported fairly large gaps where some were missing, knocked out or rotted out.  The man's hair is black and short, raggedly cut and before he died had been tucked under a stiff scarf dyed or stained red black.  The cool humid air does not bother him, but the corpse and its clothing reeks of all that is vile.  The shore is a short distance southeast.  There is no water in the shack, no clean cloth, no soap nor any other usable amenity.  Two sides of the building form part of narrow alleys, another is nearly abutting a similar shack, probably empty but it is hard to tell.  The air without is full of small sounds, waves moving the docks, moving against the docks, ropes creaking, wood protesting as it is strained and shifted.  Shore and sea birds in abundance cry as they wheel and dive, though while he was outside he could not hear voice of man or bird except in the distance.\nHe had thought to find work for a day or two and absorb information borne by dockworkers, fishermen and other tradesmen near the shore.  Not that he would be able to remember it all, nor would it be as much as he feels he needs to know, but it would be something.  It would be more than he knows now.  He would like to know a little less right now, too.  No reason for the man to follow him, unless instructed by those who had given Telen direction earlier, and he supposes it makes sense they would have.  Telen is dressed well by comparison and the clothing is clean.  His fastidious habits have not degraded so much that he does not wash his clothing.  Exceptionally displeased with that thought -that maybe he should not wash his clothing so often--, he scowls and considers his situation.  A dead man and his clothing, likely a cutpurse but possibly worse, certainly a man willing to do violence.  And Telen unscathed but without clothing, all hidden for the moment in an abandoned shack.\nNot entirely unscathed, he thinks as he twists to look at his sides and the back of his legs.  There is a sore spot on one shoulder and scrapes and light bruising along his shins, and one hand is stiff and the wrist swollen.  He is only just noticing it, though he does remember fumbling with the one hand and then favoring it.\nTelen stops thinking about reasons.  The man is dead.  What he needs to do is wash his clothing and find a new inn, leaving the body to decay and be devoured by creeping things.  An ignoble end, fitting to the man's short and ignoble life.  He shrugs.  It is either that or drag it to the shore, weight it down and drop it in the water.  He runs his nails across his skin, flaking off residue where liquid soaked through and smeared across his chest and arms.  The rest of his body is inspected and similarly cleansed.  He dons his trousers, dark enough to hide most of the spatter, and slides his sheathed knife into a long pocket.  The entire length does not fit, but it will probably stay put.  His belt is ruined and he balls the rest of his own clothing with the dead man's and buckles the belt around it.  The neat ball goes into the water on his roundabout way back into the city.\nFor an annoyingly tense moment, the ball bobs on the surface of the dark water, though heavily and, feeling exposed and vulnerable silhouetted against a grey sky, he has to watch it to make sure it does sink.  It does.  Wearing only the boots and trousers, he finds a back way into his inn and climbs three sets of narrow stairs to his room.  The day's events crash down and cover him like a landslide and for long minutes, he sits in the center of his room on the floor bowed down, elbows on knees, head in hands.\nThere is some comfort in the stillness and quiet, and after sitting long enough for his muscles to begin to protest, he unfolds and stands, locks his door and washes with tepid water from a ceramic basin on the floor by his bed.  It is a cheap room, and there is only the basin and the thin mattress on a rough legged frame, and one window that opens and can be shuttered and latched tight from the inside.  He leaves it open.  He has paid for the room for two days and leaving will not attract untoward attention.  So his few days in the city have drained his resources doubly, as he will again rent a room at a new inn for more than a day, and he does not plan to stay past a night.\nHis new room has lice in it.  Or, specifically, the mattress has lice in it.  In a fit of peeve, he powders it and pounds the lumpy cloth, certain he is crushing as many insects as the powder poisons.  He will not wake covered in sores and bites in the morning.  He realizes the attitude must change, but cannot do it yet.  Tomorrow, after he's eaten, he will better deal with what is left of his integrity.  He might even be able to laugh at the pain.\nA small, wobbly table is lifted and set next to the low bed.  An impulse to disassemble the table and reseat the joints is ignored for the second time.  He sits on the bed and draws his legs up to tuck under his knees.  All of his possessions fit into a small trunk, strapped for hauling, and a large satchel, which is open and the canvas pulled down to reveal the contents jammed into the wide mouth.  He should write a note to those in Caemlyn, though he has nothing much to say.  It is only preparation for things to come, but necessary.  He should write a letter to Lierna, telling her -everything he is thinking.  Though maybe less of what he is feeling.  Has he not said that, already? Better to leave her alone, and let what he expects will happen, to happen.  This will only take time, and time will pass, whether he wills it or no.\n

With the Dragon Reborn's black-coated Asha'man still holding the Sun Palace safe and devoid of any contention for the throne, there has been a tentative peace in the city while the nobles floundered for position they could not fully enforce.  Lord Dobraine Taborwin has been raised as regent for the Lord Dragon in Cairhien.\n\nPower struggles fizzled with as much fanfare as they started up, though bets are fair that the scheming has simply moved under the table.  Peace is maintained, as few are foolish enough to outright challenge the Dragon's ruling, though just as few are perfectly content with the decision, and grumbling is fairly constant.\n\nOptimists point out that at least Dobraine is Cairhienin, while pessimists proclaim his kowtowing to the Dragon Reborn makes him unsuitable, stating that their country has been handed over to the mad, menacing Asha'man.  The Sun Palace is still secured, though, and commerce continues apace as the city rebuilds from the shock of losing its monarch.\n\n

7783	2007-06-04 13:25:53	107	4204	Fwd: White Tower Major RP/Event Thread	\n`7--] `6A Moment in Tyme MUD Mail System`7 [--\n`7Date`6:`7 Thu Feb 22 23:41:01 2007\n`7From`6:`7 Balinor\n`7Subj`6:`7 White Tower Major RP/Event Thread\n`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7\n`7CC`6: `7Nicodemus Balinor Maelyn Shai'tan Syrah Rissa Lucardo \n\nTo: Nicodemus, Lucardo, Rissa, Syrah, Shai'tan, Maelyn, Balinor\nRe: White Tower Major RP/Event Thread\n.\nLadies and Gentlemen:\n.\nMaelyn and I sat down tonight and discussed the possibilities for\nan event for the Tower that would capture the interest of many of\nthe guildmembers while at the same time rewarding the members of\nthe guild for their participation. We agreed that, given events\nof the past few months (namely the Asha'man raid and the reunifi-\ncation of the White Tower), the best idea would be for the Tower\nto recover an item of great value that would somehow shift the\ndynamic of the relationship with the Black Tower. We brainstormed\nfor some time on what the item would be - whether it would be an\noffensive or defensive item, how powerful it would, the effects\nit would create. In the end, we agreed on a ter'angreal that would\nhave the effects of a Stedding, but only on men and their ability\nto grasp Saidin. The ter'angreal would affect the entire city of\nTar Valon, or if not that big an area, definitely the entire White\nTower and associated grounds. Realizing that this is an extremely\nimportant item in terms of affecting the RP between the White and\nBlack Towers, we decided that an extensive set of RP events would\nbe undertaken by the Tower GLs to recover this lost artifact. We\neven went so far as to develop the prelude to this event, a small\nset of passages that follow below that will kick the RP off at the\nWhite Tower and that will lead a group of Tower guildmembers into\nthe Blight in search of this ter'angreal. \n.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn exerpt of the passage discovered by Rosalyn Aes Sedai, a Brown \nSister studying the Tower histories for references to male channelers: \n".... the statue seems to have been carved by a master from the darkest \nobsidian. It depicts a forlorn man, blindfolded and bound in chains. \nHe hangs his head, an expression of despair carved on his features. \nThe statue reflects the light in odd ways. The shifting shadows on \nits surface make it appear the man is struggling against his bonds, \nthough of course, a statue cannot move. This was the account by \nTielle Notura of the White Ajah, advisor to Mabriam en Shareed, \nQueen of Aramaelle. Tielle Notura's account tells of the item \ncreating the same affect as the Ogier Stedding, a dampening of the \nability to sense the source, but strangely enough, that it only had \nthis affect on men and the male half of the True Source, Saidin. She \nmused that it was possibly created during the Breaking of the World \nto allow men to travel while still provided the sanctuary they sought \nat that time in Steddings, a defense against the madness of the time. \nIt may have been created at a later time, as an aid to capturing and \nprotecting those men who still roamed free." The passage continues, \ndescribing the parties that would be sent out to search for madmen, \nbut the statue is not mentioned again.\n.\nYet another passage is found, this one in a diary written by Stasi \nSedai, a Brown who lived around FY 150, a centuary and a half after \nthe end of the Trolloc Wars. She is relating her travels to the city \nof Jieranelle, in Rhamdashar, and describing some of the sights. She \nmentions an "odd statue of a man set on a table in the manor house \ncourtyard. The shadows played oddly about it. Unfortunately, I did \nnot have the time to study it properly. I only noticed it as the \ncaravan was pulling out. Perhaps I will be able to return soon and \ngive it the study it deserves. I did ask Rhodan about it, but he \nsaid he knew little about it, other than it had been in his family \nfor generations. He said it made him feel uneasy, and thought he \nmight one day sell it to someone else. I asked him to let me know if \nhe decided to be rid of it, as I would consider purchasing it myself." \nThe diary continues for many years, but the only other reference to \nthe statue is near the end. Stasi Sedai laments that she regrets never \nhaving gotten back to study the statue, and makes a note to herself to \nmention it to one of the younger Sedai to follow up.\n.\nRosalyn realized the magnitude of this discovery, of the potential \nsuch an item might have in the world today, with male channelers \nrunning free across the lands. Her continued research revealed that \nthe city of Jieranelle, in Rhamdashar, was located in what today is \nthe fallen nation of Malkier, in the Blight. Pouring over old maps \nand correlating it with new maps, she was able to determine the general \narea in Malkier where the city was located, but could not refine it any \nfurther.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n.\nFrom here, Rosalyn Sedai reports these finds to the Hall of the Tower,\nwho will form a committee to determine whether or not this holds enough\nmerit upon which they will base an exploratory expedition. It is here\nthat the RP events will kick-off. I fully expect at least a dozen events\n(and much likely more), with small RP between guildmembers and even\noutside of the guild spawning as a result.\n.\nMaelyn and I feel that the item we've proposed is significant enough\nto warrant a major RP event as this, but that it will also not shift\nthe balance enough to majorly impact RP on the mud. It also would be\na major reward for the White Tower, which would effectively by protected\nagainst male channelers as long as the statue was in the White Tower.\n.\nPlease reply to me with comments. I am spearheading the effort to get\nthis RP event going and will be putting some major time in when I get\nback from Mexico to organize and kick things off. Basically, I believe\nthat I need buy-in from all of the Imms I've sent this to in order for\nit to be a successful event, so please consider this carefully and\nlet us know as soon as you can so that we can move forward.\n.\nOn behalf of Maelyn and myself, thanks.\n.\nRegards,\nBalinor\n

No idea what happened\nto it. I think some zones that we should definitely have since\nwe are getting a fight code in would be the Blight, for very\ndifficult monsters, the Waste, also for difficult monsters,\nand the Shaido Hold in the wetlands, again, for hard monsters to\nfight. \n\nI don't really know if we need to have many more zones put in\nbecause we don't have a population to sustain their use. However,\nif we get people in certain guilds that would require an area, \nI'd have no problem seeing one put in. \n\n\nWhat else would you like concerning building?

The first child of a minor \nCairhienin merchant, he was trained from a young age to take over his father's \nbusiness, and so he spent from age 6 to age 13 drearily behind a desk, learning \nto balance ledgers and follow trading trends. His mother, a seamstress by \ntrade, always told the most amazing stories of adventure and travel, much at \nodds with the boring life that Liahm was quickly growing into. His younger \nsister had to learn as well, but she wasn't pushed as much as Liahm by their \nfather. The situation quickly grew to grate on the young boy, and he ran off, \nhitching his fortunes to a passing menangerie. Running messages and tending to \nprops wasn't much more exciting, but at least he was around exciting people, \nand constantly moving through new lands. \n\nHe lasted four years with the menagerie, and then found himself back in \nCairhien, bored to tears of mucking out stalls and no closer to performing in \nany way, shape, or form. By this time, his mother and father were dead (she \ngrew sick shortly after he fled home, he passed on shortly after she did) and \nhis sister had been taken away to Tar Valon (the loss of the second child was \nwhat pushed his mother over the edge). With nothing of his family left, Liahm \nswore himself to House Tarborwin as a guardsman, sure that this was the way to \nglory, adventure, and excitement. And in a way, he was right.\n\nHis training progressed rapidly enough, as the young man was used to physical \nexertion, and learned quickly, and soon he was a newly minted Guardsman of \nHouse Tarborwin. He served the House for several years, skirmishing against \nAndorans and Tairens before he was 20 and the world changed. Aiel poured over \nthe Dragonwall again. Liahm fought with the rest of his House, doing what he \ncould to save the city of his birth. The intervention of the Lord Dragon and \nhis Aiel undoubtedly saved the young Guardsman's life, and Liahm was left to \nhelp his House rebuild in the wake of the war.\n\nThen the Lord Dragon was taken from the very Sun Palace, and Liahm, now a \nSquadman, was chosen to accompany Lord Dobraine to succor the Savior of \nCairhien. He fought long and hard, seeing the devastation wrought by women who \ncould channel. That wrath was surpassed as the sun outshines a candle by the \nfury of the black-coated men who arrived and ended the battle. Then and there, \nLiahm Dalren decided that he would serve the Lord Dragon whose subjects had \nsaved him twice now. On the first recruiting trip to Cairhien, the young man \nmade himself available to the Asha'man, his awe of the black-coated \nslaughterers overshadowing his family's particular fear and hatred of male \nchannelers. Expecting to be shunted aside to train the Legion of the Dragon, \nLiahm was surprised and frightened when it was found that he could learn to \nchannel.\n\nHe was taken to the Farm just weeks after the battle of Dumai's Wells, and \nthere his true training began. Crispness and precision marked the young \nCairhienin's style, although now and then hints of the showmanship learned with \nthe menagerie showed through. He quickly became a Soldier, and his strength and \nability with the One Power marked him for quick promotion, and he quickly \nbecame a specialist in combating other channelers. It was his loyalty to Mazrim \nTaim, however, that gained him the sword pin of a Dedicated, and sent him to \nthe White Tower in the Raid. He was one of the men who Traveled into the Ajah \nHalls, and he spent the entire duration of the Raid subduing recalcitrant Aes \nSedai with all indication of great enjoyment.\n\nAlthough his sense of adventure chafes at the forced inactivity at the Black \nTower, he trains for the day when the Aes Sedai once more decide that they are \nmore important than the Asha'man, fully intending to put them back in their \nplace (beneath the polished boots of the Asha'man, in his mind) when that day \ncomes. How this belief will change when it becomes apparent that his sister \nKadiana, now an Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah, is at the Black Tower is yet to be \nseen.\n

The first child of a minor Cairhienin merchant, he was trained from a young age to take over his father's business, and so he spent from age 6 to age 13 drearily behind a desk, learning to balance ledgers and follow trading trends. His mother, a seamstress by trade, always told the most amazing stories of adventure and travel, much at odds with the boring life that Liahm was quickly growing into. His younger sister had to learn as well, but she wasn't pushed as much as Liahm by their father. The situation quickly grew to grate on the young boy, and he ran off, hitching his fortunes to a passing menangerie. Running messages and tending to props wasn't much more exciting, but at least he was around exciting people, and constantly moving through new lands.\n\nHe lasted four years with the menagerie, and then found himself back in Cairhien, bored to tears of mucking out stalls and no closer to performing in any way, shape, or form. By this time, his mother and father were dead (she grew sick shortly after he fled home, he passed on shortly after she did) and his sister had been taken away to Tar Valon (the loss of the second child was what pushed his mother over the edge). With nothing of his family left, Liahm swore himself to House Tarborwin as a guardsman, sure that this was the way to glory, adventure, and excitement. And in a way, he was right.\n\nHis training progressed rapidly enough, as the young man was used to physical exertion, and learned quickly, and soon he was a newly minted Guardsman of House Tarborwin. He served the House for several years, skirmishing against Andorans and Tairens before he was 20 and the world changed. Aiel poured over the Dragonwall again. Liahm fought with the rest of his House, doing what he could to save the city of his birth. The intervention of the Lord Dragon and his Aiel undoubtedly saved the young Guardsman's life, and Liahm was left to help his House rebuild in the wake of the war.\n\nThen the Lord Dragon was taken from the very Sun Palace, and Liahm, now a Squadman, was chosen to accompany Lord Dobraine to succor the Savior of Cairhien. He fought long and hard, seeing the devastation wrought by women who could channel. That wrath was surpassed as the sun outshines a candle by the fury of the black-coated men who arrived and ended the battle. Then and there, Liahm Dalren decided that he would serve the Lord Dragon whose subjects had saved him twice now. On the first recruiting trip to Cairhien, the young man made himself available to the Asha'man, his awe of the black-coated slaughterers overshadowing his family's particular fear and hatred of male channelers. Expecting to be shunted aside to train the Legion of the Dragon, Liahm was surprised and frightened when it was found that he could learn to channel.\n\nHe was taken to the Farm just weeks after the battle of Dumai's Wells, and there his true training began. Crispness and precision marked the young Cairhienin's style, although now and then hints of the showmanship learned with the menagerie showed through. He quickly became a Soldier, and his strength and ability with the One Power marked him for quick promotion, and he quickly became a specialist in combating other channelers.

Like many rural women she was trained by her mother and other women of her village to cook, clean, care for their family and heal using herbs and ancient techniques. By the age of thirteen she already showed great promise in helping those in neighboring villages, aiding her mother as the local midwife. The village located in River Erinin Region, was not so backward as to not notice when the girl showed exceptional talent with healing arts. Though with all the trouble and turmoil in the realms she was immediately sent from her home to Tar Valon in the hopes she will either be trained as Aes Sedai or she will come home "cured" of any attachments of the one power.\nDescription: Too old to be a child, too young to be a full grown adult, the girl stands on the cusp of becoming a woman. She is slender and petite, standing at approximately five feet, and moving with poise and grace that gives her a sylphlike appearance. Large silk like rich curls of light blond hair cascade past her shoulders to brush mid-back, the lengthy locks brushed to sheen and pinned back with small combs. Large almond shaped eyes dominate her features, the deep blue orbs flecked with soft hues of light blue and silver. Long dark lashes frame her large eyes the natural curl sweeping up towards neatly shaped brow. A slender nose, creamy ivory complexion, and petite and full lips give her an innocent look. A gracefully long neck only adds to her sylphlike appearance as it slopes down to meet with her slender shoulders.\n\n        She is clad in a summery frock of soft white linen, the lightweight dress cut in an empress style waistline gathered just beneath the bust and falling in soft folds to the floor. The empress waistline is trimmed with a  pale green ribbon that is embroidered with little vines dotted with flowers. The sleeves are long and form fitting, held closed with a bronze button at the wrist.\n

The whole grid system is going away\nalso, because it prevents combat use with mobs.\n\nDon't hesitate to let us know about any other MUD features that are not accessible,\nand if you're around when we open the new code for beta testing, be sure to sign up\nand test it out for us.  :)\n\n-Duren\n

His eyes darted around the tent, colorful spots \nblinking in and out of his vision. A painting hung from the southern entrance, depicting a disproportionaly large man in the lookout post of a small vessel, \nfloating in the sky with a hand pointing towards something afront, in the distance. Ironically, the man's head had been pierced by a stray piece of wood. The \nroom was covered in dirt and... and blood. A gaping hole in the tent wall revealed the street and the burning tents across.\nAlarming shouts and the sound of thunder and ringing of steel foreshadowed the sight that was about to meet Dawynn. Flinching, he stood up and covered the \nfive paces of ground that lead out to the large, gaping hole and the street. The large pool of smeared blood that lead to the street looked as if someone had \ncrawled or been dragged across, out of the hole into chaos while bleeding profously. His eyes darted across the ground outside the tents in the Shaido camp \nand he saw men lying about, groaning in pain at the loss of limbs or holes torn up by the ball of flame that had hid the tent. He winced, seeing his uncle \nlying with stumps where there had been legs, clothes charred and turning into ashes.\n He did not have time to mourn. He needed to run, right this instant. He \ntossed away the white garnments of gai'shain and scurried about, looking for clothes. He would not be made an Aiel slave again.\nDawynn is a Tar Valoner orphan who grew up in the care of his uncle, Hamin. His uncle was a merchant of sorts, serving as a middle-man, or as he himself \npreferred to call it, 'the vital link between the interest and the interested'. In his company, he grew up on the roads, travelling along the trade-routes by \nroad from Cairhien in the east to Arad Doman in the East. He had seen a lot of interesting things in the world but never quite felt at ease not having a \nhome. At one point, when he was 12, they stayed in Tar Valon for more than two years, which was the longest \nhe had ever stayed in a single place. His uncle \ntook good care of him, as well as he could considering he was not very wealthy and could not settle down in a place long enough. His bargain with two \nmerchants from Two Rivers who would sell him their acquired tobacco in Tar Valon ensured that he could stay in Tar Valon for those two years, finally \ngranting Dawynn and opportunity to sleep under the same roof.\nThe boy though, never felt that being sedentary granted him any special sense of belonging. His home was simply someplace else, with someone else, and he \nnever found himself being like the next person. He always had questions, as if there should be more to life than existing, that in these times, turning \nincreasingly menacing every year, there was some place out there where he could do something extraordinary. On their way from Malden, the town was overtaken \nby Shaido and him and his uncle were forced to become gai'shain.

Once he discovered what she was, the spy killed herself before he could get any information.  He did find some differently colored threads he thinks she used as signals and also a small ivory plaque inset with a raven in solid gold.  His not brilliant conclusions are the Seanchan are obviously interested in Andor and Caemlyn and it may be worth capturing another Seanchan to interrogate to find if there is any significance to the plaque.\n

The returning Aes Sedai and Gaidin are not really the main\nproblem.  It's the large amount of Novices, soldiers and camp\nfollowers.\n\n2. Parol asserted that he was underestimating the number of\nNovices, because of one reference that suggested the Rebel\nTower actually had 1,000 novices.  I looked this up, and it\ndoes say 'near a thousand' in Crossroads of Twilight.  So,\n400-450 is actually quite a generously small number.\n\n3. Parol feels that Tar Valon can maintain about 15,000 soldiers\nif about 10,000 of them are sent away and the last 5,000 are\nsent back to their regular jobs around Tar Valon to be called\nup as needed.  "Of course, they'd probably be maintained in\nthe state that the Rebel Camp was maintained - slightly short\nrations and going without any luxuries.  The Aes Sedai, of\ncourse, wouldn't be under any such restrictions, since they'd\nstill be in the White Tower, which was designed for their\nfull number and then some."\n\n4. Parol suggested using Traveling to bring supplies to the\ncamp and relieve some of the stress, if Aes Sedai powerful\nenough to Travel can be convinced to do something so mundane\nas to help carts move into Tar Valon, 'but that won't solve\neverything in and of itself either.'\n\nSo, that's his take on it.  Here is mine. :>\n\nI agree with his first point.  The returning Aes Sedai and\nGaidin are not the issue, nor are the Accepted.  It is the\nexcess number of Novices, the army, and camp followers.\nEven with the reduced numbers (400-450 as opposed to 1000),\nNovice rooms would still be overcrowded, assuming we go by\nbook Novice rooms... if the double-bunking Novice thing is\nunique to this game and timeline, that's fine... then I guess\nthere's nothing to worry about.  But I did want to point out\nthat Novice rooms are SMALL, as mentioned in my previous mail.\nBut double-bunking in the Accepted quarters would probably\nsolve the problem.\n\nNow to the soldiers and camp followers.  I honestly don't\nthink we need to send them away.  They came to Tar Valon for\na reason, and Maty is not likely to just send them packing,\nwhen she can likely make use of them.  For now, they can do\nlike in the books, and stay in the towns alongside the river.\n\nAs for supplying them and feeding them... this is where I\nbelieve Parol is wrong.  I was reading through Crossroads of\nTwilight last night, and came across a comment from Gareth\nBryne to Egwene, saying how, once they took the city, they\nwould be able to eat better, but they couldn't, because of\nElaida allowing ships in to carry more soldiers that she had\nChubain recruiting.\n\n1. We don't have an Elaida overcrowding the harbor with ships\nfull of freshly recruited soldiers.\n\n2. Tar Valon is welcoming Gareth's soldiers, and it never came\nto war.  And it isnt winter yet, and as far as I know, there\naren't weevils and rot and the like infesting the food.  So,\nfood supplies are not going to be as much of an issue as\nthey were in the books.  Parol is trying to convince us that\nthese soldiers are going to have to live in conditions that\nare exactly like they were in the books, and this simply is\nnot the case.\n\nFinally, I've got an idea that might give Gareth's soldiers\nsomething to do besides sit around.  Tarmon Gai'don is on\nits way.  I've thought about the idea of seeing a couple of\noutposts built south of the Border Nations, sort of as a\nsemi-long-term goal.  These outposts would house soldiers...\nBryne's Boys... and perhaps Aes Sedai as well, to act sort\nof as a reinforcement in case the Shield of the North should\nsomehow fail, or in case the Borderlands need aid should the\nShadow suddenly decide to wake up and start moving.  That's\nif I could convince Bryne to agree to it.  Meanwhile, this\nleaves these soldiers close enough to Tar Valon in case they\nare needed as well.  The area I am thinking of are the forest\nareas north of Tar Valon, and south of Arafel/Kandor/Shienar.\nThere is plenty of water and the possibility of trade along\nthe river, there is plenty of forest for lumber for building.\nThere are major roads leading to and from the Borderlands for\nfurther commerce, and there are flatlands and the like that\nwould be ideal for farming.  I was thinking, basically of\nbuilding two 'fort' towns, each with 5000 soldiers.  It's a\nlong-term goal, and doesn't solve our immediate problems,\nbut it might be an option, so we don't have to just send all\nthe soldiers away, when we could put them to good use. :)\nFinally, I think Tar Valon could easily support the remaining\nsoldiers.  That's assuming I'm correct in my assumption that\nElaida didn't have a chance to build up the Tower Guard as\nmuch as she did by book 10.  Anyway, this is getting long. :)\n\nMaty\n

Before doing this, though, I wanted to talk\nto Rissa and Syrah about what we could offer potential builders\nwho apply to the MUD.\nGenerally, it's hard to retain skilled builders. I would say\nthat having two more would be the perfect amount in order\nto finish Tar Valon and the surrounding areas.

Before you go and get upset, here's why:\n\n1.)  We already have said RP log system.  We've had it for years, just no-one uses it.\n2.)  I already have a task on the dotproject board about revamping the RP log system to make it even more feature-complete.\n\nAlso, I made another very significant improvement to the mob program code.  You know\nhow before it would respond immediately to events?  So if you were following someone\nand you followed someone into a room, the mob would greet him before you made it into\nthe room, so you never saw the first greeting?\n\nWell, I changed all that.  Now when an event occurs, it gets added to a list.\nAnd then after all players commands have been processed, the mud goes through\nthis list, and processes all the events in the order they were received.\nNow as part of this same code, I added a delay variable, so each event can\nhave a different delay.  The delay being how long it will sit in that events\nlist before it executes.  This also allowed me to create an even better way\nof handling delays than with mob pause.\n\nRemember I said mob pause actually leaves your script in memory, and your script just calls the\nmain game loop a given number of times (depending on how long you delay) ?\nSo here's what happens:\n\ngame_loop calls command_interpreter (Lets say command is 'east' and you walk into a mob)\n   command_interpreter calls move_character function (to move you 'east'\n      move_character checks for mob triggers, finds one, and calls mp_greet_trigger\n         mp_greet_trigger calls program_flow, to execute your script.\n            program_flow executes your script, encounters a 'mob pause' and begins calling game_loop\n               game_loop goes through and processes any pending character commands and output.  However, anything the original game_loop was working on (Such as processing people who are following you) won't be taken care of by this game loop.\nNotice now we have two game_loops, and when someone else types a command, we'll have two instances\nof command_interpreter, and then that may cause another mob trigger, which will cause another instance\nof program_flow, and that second script may have a delay in it as well.  And now we have another copy\nof game loop running while we wait for that delay.  -Plus-, the original program_flow now has to wait\nfor the second one to finish before it can ever regain control.  So if player A triggers a 5 second\nmob pause delay, and Player B triggers a 30 second delay while program A is in the process of\nit's 5 second delay, then player A will end up waiting over 30 seconds, because he has to wait for\nthe second program to finish (Even if it's in another room or zone).\n\nBasically, even though it's better than the original delay code, it's\nstill far from ideal.  My new code fixes all this.\n\nI introduced a new command, called 'halt'  It works just like mob pause, only\nbetter.  So you can do 'halt 5', to interupt your program for half a second.\nThe halt command actually saves all the data about where the script was when it stopped,\nand then adds an event onto that events buffer I added, setting the delay for whatever you\nspecify.  Then once that delay is up, the MUD will re-open the script, jump back to where\nit left off, and resume execution from that point.\n\nSo halt is definitely the preferred way to pause programs now.\n\nI also changed mprogadd so it expects a delay variable now.  If you want the mob\nto continue responding instantly to an event, without ever going on the event list,\nyou can specify a -1.  You will need to use -1 for some scripts, such as if you want\nto have a script that only blocks an exit under certain rules.  If you use the \nevent buffer, your script won't end before the move_character code needs to know whether\nor not you used 'end' or 'end 1'.  So it will assume you just did a regular 'end' and block\nthe character.\n\nAlright, now next topic.  Brailon sent me a mudmail offering to help build some.  He's\nbuilt before but he's probably a little rusty on the commands.  I'll forward the mudmail to you and syrah.\n\n-Duren\n

There was an invisible wall between the rest of\nthe camp and Lysander that simply would never be breached. They\nkept their distance from him and he from them. But this barely-\nconcealed tolerance wore on the poor boy throughout his later\nchildhood, giving him many sleepless nights and stiring dark\nthoughts in his mind... thoughts that went against every word\nof the Way that he had followed for so long.\n\nHe felt the urge to rend the life from the things around him.\nIt was a carnal urge, something born from deep inside his soul\nafter long years of neglect and disdain. It was a scream in the\ndark that only he could hear. He was seventeen when he first\nacted on this impulse, and it would prove to be one of the\ndarkest days in his life.\n\nOne of his playmates from years ago - one he hadn't spoken with\nfor days, of course - named Elsbet found him sleeping under the\nshade of an old oak tree... or so she thought. His mind was\nquite awake, actually, and he was fighting back thoughts of\ndespair and pain from a recent jest that he had become the butt\nof. Elsbet startled him from his thoughts as she approached,\nand with a lighthearted giggle she teased him about his the\nWay of the Leaf not meaning to live under a tree forever. There\nwas nothing malicious in her words, but something in him broke\nthat day - a tender chord snapped - and he did the unthinkable.\nWithout any conscious thought, he performed his First Touching\nof saidin and sent skeins of Fire into her face. The result was\nterrible.\n\nThe girl would never be called beautiful again, nor would she\nlikely find herself the object of anyone's affection, least of\nall her own, from the scarred tissue across her cheeks and nose.\nThat same day, as she lay in a delirious fever mumbling about\nLysander burning her, the boy was forced from the caravan and\ntold never to return. His parents were heartbroken, but they\nwere unwilling to leave the Tinkers even for him. Their faith\nin the Way was stronger than familial bonds, it appeared. This\nexile and rejection spurred Lysander on into a dark fury, and\nhe left the Tuatha'an without another word.\n\nUpon reaching Cairhien, the channeling sickness finally struck\nhim. Burning with fever and freezing with chills, he was at the\nmercy of the elements for two days as he lay unmoving in the\nshadows of an abandoned stall just outside the city walls. Luck\nwould favor him this time, though, and he recovered with no\nlasting damage. Well, at least no physical damage. Psycholo-\ngically, he was an empty shell devoid of any feelings except\nhatred and vengeance. Over the next two weeks, he quickly found\nthat he would have to control these urges if he wanted to live.\nNo one was willing to give food to a murderous loon, after all.\n\nBy the time his eighteenth naming day arrived, he had pushed the\ndark thoughts into his subconscious, letting them build roots in\nhis mind without giving any outward indication of the corrupt\nnature of his soul. Two more times he accidentally channeled in\nCairhien, although neither with the disasterous results his\nFirst Touching had wrought. It was on a whim that he decided to\nleave Cairhien after hearing of a band of Tinkers spotted at\nFour Kings, a small village west of Caemlyn in Andor.\n\nAs of now, he has just arrived in Caemlyn. He doesn't really\nknow what brought him to the capital. Perhaps he needed to get\naway from his heritage completely. Maybe those dark thoughts\nfestering in his soul are leading him toward the eventual,\ncataclysmic reunion with his people. Only time will tell. It\nmight be interesting to note that he's been seeking out news of\nFriends of the Dark quietly, however. But then again, pledging\nhis soul to the Dark One seems like a small step compared with\nthe journey into darkness his soul has already taken.\n

He was seventeen when he first\nacted on this impulse, and it would prove to be one of the\ndarkest days in his life.\n\nOne of his playmates from years ago - one he hadn't spoken with\nfor days, of course - named Elsbet found him sleeping under the\nshade of an old oak tree... or so she thought. His mind was\nquite awake, actually, and he was fighting back thoughts of\ndespair and pain from a recent jest that he had become the butt\nof. Elsbet startled him from his thoughts as she approached,\nand with a lighthearted giggle she teased him about his the\nWay of the Leaf not meaning to live under a tree forever. There\nwas nothing malicious in her words, but something in him broke\nthat day - a tender chord snapped - and he did the unthinkable.\nWithout any conscious thought, he performed his First Touching\nof saidin and sent skeins of Fire into her face. The result was\nterrible.\n\nThe girl would never be called beautiful again, nor would she\nlikely find herself the object of anyone's affection, least of\nall her own, from the scarred tissue across her cheeks and nose.\nThat same day, as she lay in a delirious fever mumbling about\nLysander burning her, the boy was forced from the caravan and\ntold never to return. His parents were heartbroken, but they\nwere unwilling to leave the Tinkers even for him. Their faith\nin the Way was stronger than familial bonds, it appeared. This\nexile and rejection spurred Lysander on into a dark fury, and\nhe left the Tuatha'an without another word.\n\nUpon reaching Cairhien, the channeling sickness finally struck\nhim. Burning with fever and freezing with chills, he was at the\nmercy of the elements for two days as he lay unmoving in the\nshadows of an abandoned stall just outside the city walls. Luck\nwould favor him this time, though, and he recovered with no\nlasting damage. Well, at least no physical damage. Psycholo-\ngically, he was an empty shell devoid of any feelings except\nhatred and vengeance. Over the next two weeks, he quickly found\nthat he would have to control these urges if he wanted to live.\nNo one was willing to give food to a murderous loon, after all.\n\nBy the time his eighteenth naming day arrived, he had pushed the\ndark thoughts into his subconscious, letting them build roots in\nhis mind without giving any outward indication of the corrupt\nnature of his soul. Two more times he accidentally channeled in\nCairhien, although neither with the disasterous results his\nFirst Touching had wrought. It was on a whim that he decided to\nleave Cairhien after hearing of a band of Tinkers spotted at\nFour Kings, a small village west of Caemlyn in Andor.\n\nAs of now, he has just arrived in Caemlyn. He doesn't really\nknow what brought him to the capital. Perhaps he needed to get\naway from his heritage completely. Maybe those dark thoughts\nfestering in his soul are leading him toward the eventual,\ncataclysmic reunion with his people. Only time will tell. It\nmight be interesting to note that he's been seeking out news of\nFriends of the Dark quietly, however. But then again, pledging\nhis soul to the Dark One seems like a small step compared with\nthe journey into darkness his soul has already taken.\n

By no means were they wealthy enough to\nenter the ranks of nobility, of course, but they had little to\nwant for compared with the other residents living in Caemlyn's\nOld City.\n\nAs a child, Bertran was taught sums and letters while the other\nchildren played outside. He was rarely resentful of this, how-\never. Always a level-headed child, he seemed mature beyond his\nfew years. However, he always looked forward to the occasional\ntrips outside the city when his parents decided that it was\ndue time for a merchant's visit to the outlying towns around\nCaemlyn. He would sit in the wares cart and stare out at the\nworld peacefully. There was always so much to see and do. When\nthey would make camp, he would throw caution to the wind and\nexplore the landscape like some explorer from Jain Farstrider's\nlegendary exploits.\n\nMuch of his knowledge of terrain and outdoorsmanship was self-\ntaught as a result. Foraging was easy, of course, but finding\nlive food was another matter. Not one to trap animals, Bertran\nsettled for fishing instead. He rarely caught anything worth-\nwhile, but when he did, it was a celebration like no other. As\na result, fish courses during meals quickly became his favorite\ndishes.\n\nAnd all this outdoorsmanship and exploration began to affect\nhis future, as one would expect.\n\nHis father, Reighnard, had expected that Bertran, being their\nonly child, would one day take over the family merchantile\nbusiness. It was almost expected of him to simply slip into\nthe role. But Bertran's head was not in it. He could do the\njob adequately, of course. He'd been helping his parents from\na very young age with the easier tasks involved in selling\nwares, but over time he developed different tastes in life. His\npassion became exploration and new horizons. He also took a\nliking to combat, much to his mother's chagrin. His first\nweapon was a small butterknife that he would wield against the\nvarious invisible monsters of his imagination. This early\nchoice of weaponry quickly developed into a strong affinity for\ndaggers and knives, an uncommon trait in most combatants.\n\nAs time wore on and Bertran grew into a young man, he began to\nhang around the mercenaries guarding the merchant trains more\nand more. He would ask questions incessantly. What did they do\nin their spare time? Had they been in a fight recently? Who did\nthey serve? Any knews from the outside world? And with each\nquestion, his interest in mercenary work began to outgrow his\nwaning passion for merchantilism. By his eighteenth naming-day,\nBertran had decided that he would become a sellsword. His\nparents did not take the news well at first, especially his\nfather. The family business would end with them. But it was\nBertran's life to live, and he wouldn't live under their shadow\nforever.\n\nShortly after his naming-day, he stumbled upon a vision of\nbeauty: Lady Valkaria Ankaer. While sitting in the Queen's\nBlessing one afternoon with drink in hand, the lady entered\nwith her entourage of Heron Company thugs. Bertran could tell\nalmost immediately that she was nobility. She had that air\nabout her that was unmistakable, that sense of entitlement. But\nthis illusion was quickly shattered. Valkaria was not like most\nnoblewomen. She was flirty and uncouth. She toyed with those\naround her. And she drank like a sailor ten days out from port.\nOverhearing her conversation about the Heron Company, Bertran\nwas thrilled to learn that they were in search of mercenaries.\n\nThis was his chance. Striking up the courage, he introduced\nhimself to the lady in a stuttering voice. All those years of\nconfidence seemed to melt away as he stared at Valkaria. Most\nother women didn't have this effect on him. But there was just\nsomething about her Domani features and her piercing gaze that\nunnerved the boy. Stuttering, he managed to ask about the Heron\nCompany. To his mortification, Valkaria quickly took to him as\nwell. She took him under her wing for reasons unknown and\nbrought him to the Heron Hall to meet with Commander Delray.\nAlthough he was wont to be only known as "Term," Valkaria took\nto calling him "Termy" instead. After asking why Valkaria\ncalled him that name, Bertran soon learned that if there was\none thing the lady liked, it was pet names.\n\nFrom then on, Bertran has become Valkaria's toy. She has more\nnicknames for him than he can count. Every time she glances his\nway, he bursts into a fierce blush. In fact, it would almost\nseem that Valkaria is intent on pushing these boundaries to the\nbreaking point. Is she doing this just for fun? Or does she\nhave some ulterior motive in subjecting him to such cruel\nteasing? Secretly, Bertran has come to suspect that the lady\nhas more invested in him than she lets on.\n

I would say\nthat having two more would be the perfect amount in order\nto finish Tar Valon and the surrounding areas. However,\nwhat can we offer thos builders to stay and actually work?\n\nI wanted to throw the question out to you all, to see if you\nwould be comfortable with me recruiting from without, and\nwhat we could offer those people in the event they might work\nout.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this and how I should proceed.\n\nTar Valon has been a year long process, but if we have 4 or so\ndedicated builders, it could possibly be done in a month or two.\n\nAlso, I could work on teaching mob scripting, and also over see\nwork being done on the other centers of RP.\n\nThanks,\n\nA very busy,\n-Sads\n

As he moves you may catch a glance of a very well made deep mocha leather tunic and dark `4blue`7 breeches\nwith `#gold`7 stitching. Under his tunic he wears a thin white shirt of fine silk.

As a young boy Jasil got to visit the city and as far south as Maerone while helping his father out with his trade. A few years later during the first burning of the Foregate all of his family was killed, Jasil managed to get out of the house in time to seek refuge. He followed like many of the survivors into the city once he realized he had lost his family.\n\nJasil met a young woman from the Foregate once inside Cairhien walls. They shared the story of loses and kept each other company for some time to. The woman took Jasil in you could say even if the first few months of life was rough in the streets. Not much time passed before she somehow managed to pull in a nice bit of coin to afford a decent if not nice inn for them to stay. She taught Jasil how to use daggers and knifes as well as how to move without being seen or heard for protection.\n\nAfter a couple years passed Jasil set out on his own to explore the world to see what else may be beyond what he knew. He traveled as far west as Arad Doman, Tarabon as far south as Tear, Illian, and north as far as Maradon stopping to see many things in his journeys. As you can expect that took time, it was well worth it once he was satisfied he returned to Cairhien to seek work with what he learned from the woman and his travels. For many months he worked just to get coin in order to have a place to stay and food to eat, honest or not he did what he had to. Many Houses unknown to Jasil took notice to this, most thinking how well the skills could benefit them.\n\nJasil has worked with many plotting Lords and Ladies of Cairhien he built wealth fast.\nWith only being caught once he was given a light sentence for appearance sake as strings were pulled. He served a few short months as a Sun Guard helping with the night watch over the streets. Many thieves would learn that it might be better to fight him rather than flee. After his duty with the Guard was up he was once again back to doing tasks for Houses filling his pockets even more.\n\nSome may call him an assassin, thief, or troublemaker as dark as he may seem. Over the years his pockets have become fat and remain that way. He has laid down his trade and is back to traveling seeing the world for really no good reason other than he can. Jasil remembers his life as a young boy and is returning there as a friendly, laid back, fun loving man to all he meets leaving the life once lived behind. Do remember as nice as he may seem dont cross him in a wrong way or you may lay your head on your pillow for the last time.\n\n\nLook forward to hearing from you I just came up with the background tonight so let me know if it needs work.\n\n

His parents were\nin the service of House Tesheira, the father as a \nbook-keeping scribe and mother as a lady in waiting.\nAll in all Tarem had a fairly comfortable upbringing,\nsurrounded by love and literature.

Often caught out by lifes darker moments, Kerow \nfound himself under reign of an uncaring mother and hating father. Kept \ninside all too often, the boy sustained a cruel weaning of control and \ntorture, measured out in rich amounts and resulting in his continual \nsicklyness and withdrawal to places only he could fathom.\nThen there came the day when he woke to a sliver of hope, the day after \na night where not even his own world could sustain the wealth of his \nsuffering. His ordeal had rendered him lost to consciousness, condemned \nin his mind to finally staying in his world, his last act of defiance \nlost to nightmares with but one memory. Rage. -His- day dawned as dull \nas the rest, but his eyes opened beheld a sight most would cringe from, \nyet he, he who had been given to torture and worse, saw nothing more \nthan the opening, the way out. So with mind still half delved to his \nworld and half the real, he stepped over the cold remains of his \nnightmares and into something one hundred fold more frightening, yet \nsweeter than anything his young mind could ever manifest... Freedom.\nHe lived hard, learning from trial and error in this world new to him. \nHe learned to beg from a man who saw the advantage of using him as bait \nto the kind of heart, learned to steal from a boy who saw the gain in \nhis mundane and quiet demeanor. He was taught letters and numbers by a \nwhore who often sent him into the garments of her men while they were \noccupied.

Since all they could do was farm, they didn't have much money which left him slighty greedy and a bit tempermental. His parents tried to get the best for their son. But he never spent much time with them. When he was a child he was always outside, even in the harsh winters.

He would spend days on end practising his throwing until he was nearly an expert. On his trips he would live off the land and build small shelters. With his spear he would hunt small deer and take them down very quickly. Resulting from his trips into the forests, Rhadian developed excellent vision and hearing. Along with his hearing and vision, he became extremely durable. Not needing the regular rest the average man needs, he pushed himself to the limits of his body and found new levels of \nstrength. \n \nOn the rare occasions he returned home he would be found in town instead. He would sit in the Winespring Inn with a mug of ale lost in his own world. When the Gleemen frequented the inn or Green he would pay apt attention studying every move. He would watch, enraptured, when the Gleemen played their instruments. He paid such attention that he actually learned a rudimental knowledge of the flute. \n \nOne day he decided needed a change of scenery. Not wanting a big to-do about his leaving, he merely left a note on the kitchen table explaining that he was 17 now and wanted to make his own way in the world. Explaining that he would be in Caemlyn if they needed him for some reason, he packed a few objects and some clothes and left. He threw everything into a backpack, picked a direction and began his journey. Whenever he came upon a crossroads, he'd pick a direction at random and hope it worked. If he got lost, he'd use the knowledge of the land he gained from his forest trips to find the right direction again.\n \nHis journey finally brought him to Caemlyn, though it took him several weeks. Fortunately, he always seemed to get lucky and find a small woods he could hunt in. He camped the small tent he had packed in his backpack.

Finding a job in the stables of the Silvergate Inn, he arranged to stay in a small room in the upstairs inn rooms. As soon as he was settled in his new room, Rhadian went in search of Gleeman. Finding some in the \nQueen's Blessing Inn, he settles in for a night of study. The days after were filled with mucking out stalls and brushing down horses, his nights were filled with either the study of Gleeman and their antics or his own small shows in the rundown taverns of the city. \n \nLearning everything he could from watching the Gleeman he listened to the inn's gossip. Hearing of the Asha'man amassing near Caemlyn, he found his interest piqued. He decided joining an army would be much more interesting than entertaining the rest of his life.

In my first, as WM Imm\n(Parol), I'm concerned by the claims that Rhadian taught himself the use\nof arms. Knowing how to throw a punch, not stab yourself with a dagger,\nand not trip over a spear is one thing. But actually teaching yourself\nto be a highly effective combatant in any of the three methods is unlikely\nand not in keeping with our WM policy. You'll have to cut it back to\nfamiliarity with the methods of combat, but no great skill.\n\nIn my second capacity, as Asha'man GL, my main concern is the direct\nconnection to Emond's Field and the possibility that the character may\nhave (and given his age, almost certainly would have) known the major\nbook-characters. I would very much prefer Rhadian come from one of the\nother Two Rivers towns. A minor point is that Gleemen very rarely came\nthrough the Two Rivers (as demonstrated by the clamor over Thom in Book\n1), but you could have learned your rudimentary knowledge of the flute\nduring your time watching/talking to Gleemen in Caemlyn.\n\nYour description is a slightly more serious concern to me. On MiT we\ndon't include actions in descriptions, because it that would mean that\nyou are doing that action every time someone glances at you, and even if\nyou are tied up or otherwise immobilized. Chopping the last paragraph\nfrom your description (the one with the actions regarding the dagger and\nthe book) should satisfy that concern.\n\nI'd like to see another background submitted taking these changes into\naccount, and I'll try to get back to you a great deal sooner this time.\n\n-Liahm/Parol.\n

He has\nlong, black hair, and is of a medium build.  He is a young man, wears his beard\nin the fork style, and garments are usually of a causal attire, yet he\noccasionally will be seen wearing some of the most expensive.  \n\nFrom the age he was able to walk and hold a weapon he was trained in several\nweapons, as is the normal for borderlanders.  He is the youngest of the\nfamily's children, consisting of three sons and one daughter.  His family\nlacked for very little, and thus, was tutored by some of the best teachers that\ncould be found in Kandor.  His days was filled with training all throughout his\nchildhood until he became an adult.  Unlike his brothers, he did not enlist in\nthe army.  Needless to say his father did not like this decision, but supported\nthe young man in his interests to trade.  He set out at the age of eight-teen,\nstarting out small in his trade ventures.  Within a couple of years, though, he\nbecame well-known for being fair in his dealings, and his business grew.  He\nhas a soft heart for the poor, sick, and homeless, often times giving large\nsums of money away to such causes, yet hates thieves, murderers, and corrupt\nlenders.  Such lenders have been known to come up missing while he is in the\narea, suddenly replaced, selling out, or outright never seen again.  Currently,\nhis caravan suffered a brutal ambush, and he lost several men, himself being\ninjured in the process.  Accidentally, he stumbled across a brooding Aes Sedai\nshortly after this incident.  She teasingly accussed him of being not good\nenough to train with the best in Tar Valon.  This Aes Sedai, which did not give\nher name until much later on, sparked his interests, even though she was, at\nbest, grumpy most of the time.  He intends to speak to this strange Aes Sedai\nonce more, even though he has set his mind on journeying to Tar Valon, and\nseeing if these southlanders are as good as rumour has it.  \n\n

Starting the construction on\nElaida's palace has given me an idea for what to do with all\nthose extra soldiers.  So here is what Maty is going to do:\n\nThe lower floor of the palace will be used as a research center,\nas planned.  Research designed to encourage cooperation between\nAsha'man and Aes Sedai, and mostly under the supervision of\nthe Red Ajah, who will be required to make regular reports to\nMaty of any progress made.  The upper floors of the palace\nwill be a Tower.  In the books, it says that Elaida was in\nfact planning to make her palace taller than the White Tower\nitself.  I'm not going to make a bunch of rooms for that. I'm\njust going to make it taller, as in, a tower.  A tower in\nwhich to house hundreds of soldiers.  Maty is going to call it\n'The Tower of the Night Watch', and the entire palace will be\ndedicated to fighting Tarmon Gai'don.  Maty will attempt to\nsee if she can rally these soldiers to prepare to fight in\nthe Last Battle, by giving them a place to stay, and giving\nthem a name: The Night Watch.  The White Tower will also\nsupport their training, and the Tower of the Night Watch will\nhave its own kitchens, and its own staff, which can be taken\nfrom any other extra people who have come to Tar Valon with\nthe rebel army.  The new palace will also have training grounds,\nrooms dedicated to specific research, as well as gardens and\nsuch.  It will be within the Tower grounds, and will connect\nto the White Tower gardens via an elaborate hedge maze, as well\nas regular walkways.\n\nTo elaborate more on the soldiers, the Tower portion of the\npalace will be their home.  Each floor of the Tower will house\nbunks for the soldiers, like a huge barracks on three different\nlevels.  There will be a dining hall on the second floor, where\nboth soldiers, and researchers can join together to eat.  The\nsoldiers' duty will be to protect the research palace from any\nunwanted visitors, such as darkfriends or worse.  The purpose\nof the Tower itself is to act as a watchtower for any major\nthreats within or without the city.  The soldiers will keep\nthat watch, and perhaps be assigned missions to investigate\nthis or that disturbance that might be shadow-related, with\na number of Aes Sedai as well.  That way, not all of the soldiers\nare actually in the Tower at the same time, so those who are not\non some mission, can rotate into the bunks of those soldiers who\nare.  I'm not sure exactly how many the Tower will be able to\nhold all at one time, but I think it will hold a good many if\nthe description I am remembering is accurate.  It's supposed to\nbe a huge building, but within the Tower Grounds.  I think it\nwill work.  What do you think? :)\n\nMaty\n

Guilding.\n`6------------------------------------------------------------------------------`7\n`7CC`6: `7Maelyn Balinor I spoke briefly with Maelyn, and we discussed in brief\njoining.  As such, I have prepared a BG with the hopes that it meets your\napproval for guilding me as a guest so that we may conduct RP that will\neventually see me into the position of a Warder Trainee.  So here goes, please\nnote that I'm perfectly willing to amend whatever it is you feel needs\nchanging.  \n\nBorn in the Town of Sidon, Sevristh Kigali grew up the only child of relatively\nwealthy merchants of Alum.  Their estate, though not lavish or grandiose as\nmany in Jehannah might be, was quite well known amongst the community, as were\nSevristh parents.  Most of his formative years his father was absent seeing\nabout the family business, and his mother was preoccupied with many functions\nwithin the town.  After a number of small incidents that revolved around his\nnaturally mischievous nature his parents had decided to send him to Jehannah\nwhere he could stay with aunt and uncle and their sons.  \n\nIn Jehannah, his aunt tutored him and his cousins: while his uncle, a bit of a\nrenowned swordsman in those parts, instructed in the basics of swordsmanship\nand martial knowledge.  At the time, having no particularly great interest in\nthe craft Sevristh often found himself observing the city, and the people, or\nspending time out on the River Boern.  \n\nShortly after rumour passed of a great battle in the sky Sevristh made a trip\nto Sidon to visit his family, only to find that everything had been burned to\nthe ground.  Shock paralyzed him at first, and the panic set in as he tore\nthrough the ruins of his birth place.  He found bodies, but nothing he\nrecognized, and somewhere through the bleak horror of it he found an inner\npeace.  He believed that his parents were alive, that perhaps something had\ncome up that required his parents attentions with the business elsewhere and\nthat they had escaped this awful scene.  \n\nSetting out first to Jehannah to let his extended family know what had\ntranspired, he then traveled South.  Taking fare aboard a ship he sailed down\nthe River Eldar to Ebou Dar.  In Ebou Dar he sought connections to his parents\ncompany, sought anyone with any information.  Months past, his money used up,\nand still no word of encouragement.  The realities of his situation forced him\nto find a job in simple labour.  Anything that could be done to earn a few\nextra coppers that he could save to help in his search.  \n\nWord of the Dragonsworn tearing apart Ghealdan eventually made its way to\nSevristh ears, and after so much work without results he decided to return to\nJehannah and be with his cousins and their parents.  Getting a spot on a ship\nheaded North up the Eldar he was once again sailing.  The ship docked in So\nHarbor, the captain unwilling to travel further North once hearing more news\nthere, and so Sevristh was stuck for the moment.  Upon taking room and board at\nthe Golden Barge, a local inn, he was surprised to have ran into his cousins\nwho themselves had been traveling South.  Drink and dice were had, as his\ncousins relayed the events of the Dragonsworn, of the King and his hunting\naccident.  Sevristh eventually learns of the fate of his extended family at the\nhands of the Dragonsworn, of his uncle falling in with them, and of his aunt\nwho simply vanished.  Soon after his cousins made for Ebou Dar, hoping they\nmight find Sevristh there.  \n\nAfter a few days Sevristh and his two cousins chose to stay in So Harbor,\nfinding wages working for local grain merchants and simple and inexpensive\nrooming.  That is until, one day a group of armed men on horses came to the\ntown.  One of the men bore a top knot, much in the Shienarian fashion, and\nanother seemed like a smooth talking Andoran.  These men spoke of soldiering,\nof working under the finest general in all the lands.  Sevristh cousins were\neager to join, they wanted to strike back at the Dragonsworn, they wanted\nadventure, and they wanted to move on from hauling grain.  Soon enough they\nwere recruited to follow Gareth Bryne and his soldiers under the control of the\nrebel Aes Sedai.  \n\nIt was here, that Sevristh really learned the basics of soldiering, the\nrequirements of the physical labour, and the discipline involved.  And so, like\nmany other men, he found himself on the move with this great host, all the way\nto Tar Valon.  It was here, amongst these men, that he heard the stories of the\nworld beyond his small life.  It was here, that he first glimpsed an Aes Sedai,\nor so at least he believes, and though he was not close to her, he thought only\nan Aes Sedai would ride such a fine horse in such clothing with so many\nsoldiers about her and the Lord Gareth Bryne in her company.  It was also here\nthat he first saw a Warder, and the solemn dignity that the man bore as he went\nabout whatever it is such men do.  So it was also here, where in his mind he\nresolved to make something of himself once in Tar Valon, at least, should he\nsurvive the siege.  \n\n\nThat is the end of the BG.  With this BG, I've tried to take into account this\ncharacters RPEXP level of 44, while at the same time making him very much a\nnovice compared to the likes of Warders.  I have WM that could be transferred\nto this character, but as me and Maelyn discussed, my interest is in the RP. \nAnd for the sake of that RP, I'm perfectly willing to forgo whatever WM and\nlearn from the ground up in the tower.  \n\nPlease take this under consideration.  Thank you, Sevristh.  \n\n

So it was also here, where in his mind he\nresolved to make something of himself once in Tar Valon, at least, should he\nsurvive the siege.  \n\n\nThat is the end of the BG.  With this BG, I've tried to take into account this\ncharacters RPEXP level of 44, while at the same time making him very much a\nnovice compared to the likes of Warders.  I have WM that could be transferred\nto this character, but as me and Maelyn discussed, my interest is in the RP. \nAnd for the sake of that RP, I'm perfectly willing to forgo whatever WM and\nlearn from the ground up in the tower.  \n\nPlease take this under consideration.  Thank you, Sevristh.  \n\n

That being said, I was looking at starting to flesh out the\nubermap a bit. Assigning names, room-types, etc. and then starting to\nadd descriptions. So far, have there been any standards set for room\nnaming conventions or descriptions, as well as room types? For instance,\nwhen coloring room names, do you want simple colors or something more\nflashy. I generally prefer one color per word and no more than one or\ntwo colors per room name, but that's just me. I've seen both as I've\nwalked around, and just wanted to know if there was an established\nstandard.\n\nAlso, as far as room types go, do we want rivers to be swimable or\nnon-swimable? Or should there be a variation of both? Has there been\nany insight in the ubermap as to which is which? Right now I could\nbuild them all one way, and just change them individually as it's decided\nwhich rooms should be which. However, are most going to be swim or no swim?\n\nI know mobprogs are probably a higher priority right now, but fleshing\nout the map seems like it will fit into my schedule a bit better.

The young Lady returned her admirer's passion, but her father was a notoriously elitist, power-hungry member of nobility and would never allow his daughter to besmirch the family name by marrying into the peasantry.  In a shrewd move worthy of any of the scheming nobles in their manor houses, the merchant found a long-forgotten country lord who had drunk and gambled his family fortune away and been left destitute.  The lovelorn merchant offered the Lord a healthy sum - enough to set him for the rest of his presumably short life - in exchange for the man's lands and titles.  From the bottom of his barrell, the drunken noble immediately agreed to switch his identity with the merchant and leave Cairhien in perpetuity.\n\n`&Gemini\n`7The plan worked brilliantly and the Baron welcomed Laurent Chastaine of House Delovinde as his new son-in-law.  Laurent and his new bride Evylyn ran away together with the comingled funds of noble houses and the love from romance stories, taking to the road to live an indulgent life as hidden noble merchants.  Adding to their inherited wealth, Laurent continued his merchant trade, and soon the two were rather stupendously rich.  Before two years had passed, Evylyn gave birth to fraternal twins, a boy they named Willem Everett (after his father's 'real' name) and a girl they called Ailsa Collette.  The two were thick as theives, and because of their close relationship, the two parents remained relatively free to continue their love affair.\n\n`&White Collar, Black Hat\n`7Growing up mostly on the road, with their parents largely leaving them to their own devices, Ailsa and Willem learned to take care of each other and themselves even as their personalities began to diverge.  As soon as they were old enough to understand, the twins were told of their heritage, both real and purchased, and instructed in how to comport themselves as nobles.  Precocious and shrewd, Ailsa thought it great fun to live a life of constant trickery and deceit, while Willem took the stance of actually trying to grow into and earn the title his father bought before his birth. \n`7Though the twins never lost their otherworldly sense of or love for one another, their differing perspectives caused them to begin branching out for alternate ways to experience life.  For Willem, this meant spending more and more time with the sons and daughters of the gentry and aristocracy in every city they visited.  For Ailsa, this meant learning new and ever more crafty ways to be just barely on the wrong side of the law - never for real profit, as she had little need for the money, but mostly for the sheer fun of getting away with things.\n\n`&Great Escape\n`7For their 16th birthday, Ailsa and Willem were to be separated and have individual celebrations befitting their 'noble' stations.  Willem went with his father to the city of Cairhien to be officially presented, and as the elder child to be acknowledged as the heir to the family's titles.  Evylyn took Ailsa to Far Madding, a somewhat remote but important trading center dominated by female sensibilities, to have a proper coming out of sorts.  Though disappointed that they weren't celebrating together, the twins were not so secretly glad that they didn't have to attend the other's party, as neither sounded very enjoyable to the other.\n`7The cotillion in Far Madding ended up being a huge disappointment to Ailsa, however, as she was expected to be every inch the proper lady, and while she had the bearing and the breeding - at least in part - she was completely bored by the prospect of spending the whole night in a heavy dress parading around with stuffy nobles and their boring boy-children.  While the Ladies of Far Madding bustled around assisting her mother with preparations, Ailsa hatched a scheme of her own, and the first time she was finally left alone, she doffed the frilly dress and scaled out the window in nothing but a tight black bodysuit and her ermine-lined cloak.\n\n\n`&A Friend in the Dark\n`7Avoiding detection using the skills built up over an adolescence spent, well, avoiding detection, Ailsa found a courtyard wall that could be scaled easily.  Silently scrambling over the stone and into the treed garden on the other side, she came face to face with a young man seated quietly beside a dim lamp, reading.  The boy's pale skin and hair barely showed themselves from under his bucket hat, and as she landed on her cat burglar feet, she crouched down before him, her cloak and hood shrouding her dark skin and hair in inky shadows.  After a few awkward attempts, the two struck up a strangely comfortable conversation which spanned every topic, and before she knew it, the sun was rising.  Having safely thwarted her mother's plans for her birthday, Ailsa gave her strange new friend a kiss on the cheek - her first - and vaulted back over the wall to return to her rooms and face the chewing out she was bound to receive.\n\n`&Cloak and Dagger\n`7Over the next few years, Ailsa and Willem spent less and less time together, though they wrote to one another frequently and their love for one another has never so much as dimmed.  The younger sister divested herself of her parents early, and before the year was out after her misplanned coming out adventure she was effectively on her own.  Having literally bumped into a gleeman on the street corner while out on one of her nighttime prowls of a city - Tear, this time - she divided her time between cat burgling for fun and using her natural physical abilities and charm to develop as a Gleeman herself.  She recently earned her very own patchwork cloak, but she still prefers her shimmering black ermine-lined hooded cloak for most events.\n\n`&If you can't be good, be lucky\n`7While splitting her time training for a respectable (to some) profession and continuing her less-than-lawful practices of breaking and entering with a touch of thievery, Ailsa breaks her years-long streak of never getting caught.  In Ebou Dar one autumn evening, she chooses to lightfoot her way into the manor of a particularly vigilant young noblewoman's library.  The woman, though initially surprised to see a thief boldly enter her home, reacted swiftly and before even Ailsa's reflexes could catch up, the woman's bejeweled marriage knife was at her throat.\n`7 Luck has always favored this particular cat burglar, though, and she happened to be caught by the one person - probably in all the world - who was on the hunt for a thief to hire.  The Ebou Dari noblewoman offered Ailsa a deal: do a couple specific jobs for her and she would let the girl go on her merry way, with a little profit and a quiet word in the right circles for her trouble.  Ailsa did not need her to spell out the terms of refusal, so she found herself as a thief for hire, doing 'work' rather than having 'fun'.\n\n`&Target of Opportunity\nFor a couple years after that chance encounter, Ailsa learned how to get her hands dirty without looking any worse for the wear.  She was, by all public accounts, a rambunctious but harmless noble's daughter who had somehow managed to garner herself acceptance among the Gleemen.  Otherwise, only a select few knew the full extent of her skills.  That list slowly - carefully - grew, and bit by bit she became one of the go-to underbelly lurkers if you needed a little personal espionage or light-fingered thievery done.  She did turn down any job that went beyond petty crime - or at least what she defined as petty crime.  No job requiring physical harm to person or property was accepted.  Exchanging ownership or planting evidence was one thing: directly harming another person was something else entirely, and she didn't take those jobs.  Then one night, while staying in a countryside inn on the road to her family's estates, her twin Willem stepped in out of the rain, looking quite bedraggled and harried.  He told her the former holder of their family's titles has threatened to come forth and expose the fraud for what it is.\n`7Though she did not particularly care for her own claim to Delovinde, Willem had been struggling for years to make something of himself at court.  To have his parentage questioned thus would at best keep him as a laughingstock at court.  At worst, it could ruin him forever.  Ailsa got all the information about this blackmailer from her brother, gave him her room key, kissed him on the cheek and told him his little sister would take care of it.  For the first time in her legitimate or criminal life, Ailsa took her skills to their ultimate limit.  Slipping unnoticed in the middle of the night into the man's modest accomodations a few towns away, she was in the room for no more than five minutes.  The next morning, a maid came to wake him and instead found him lying in a pool of blood - his blood - never to wake again.\n`7Willem's legacy secured, Ailsa let the right people know that her banned list had been significantly shortened, though she balances the evil deed with good intentions, and has strict ethical criteria by which she judges a potential target.  Avenging wrongs is her general M.O., and thus far only three other targets have met her requirements.\n\n`&Lady and a Tramp\n`7With the Dragon Reborn running around setting the land afire with chaos and discord, common folk scramble to find some joy and sanity, while nobles scurry to curry favor and assure their positions.  Ailsa is there for them all - to entertain, to delight, to steal, to discredit... Even, should the need arise, to kill.\n\n\n`2Ailsa stands an unremarkable 5'4" tall.  Her trim build is athletic and well-muscled,\nbut her `3w`7id`&e h`7ip`3s`2 and `&am`!p`1l`7e b`1o`!s`&om`2 keep her from truly qualifying as slender or slim.\nHer heart-shaped face shows her skin is a shade too `7da`3r`7k`2 to qualify as `&f`#a`7i`&r`2, but neither\nis it `#w`3a`7r`#m`2 enough to indicate a significant time in the `#s`&u`#n`2.\n\n

The young Lady returned her admirer's passion, but her father was a notoriously elitist, power-hungry member of nobility and would never allow his daughter to besmirch the family name by marrying into the peasantry.  In a shrewd move worthy of any of the scheming nobles in their manor houses, the merchant found a long-forgotten country lord who had drunk and gambled his family fortune away and been left destitute.  The lovelorn merchant offered the Lord a healthy sum - enough to set him for the rest of his presumably short life - in exchange for the man's lands and titles.  From the bottom of his barrell, the drunken noble immediately agreed to switch his identity with the merchant and leave Cairhien in perpetuity.\n\n`&Gemini\n`7The plan worked brilliantly and the Baron welcomed Laurent Chastaine of House Delovinde as his new son-in-law.  Laurent and his new bride Evylyn ran away together with the comingled funds of noble houses and the love from romance stories, taking to the road to live an indulgent life as hidden noble merchants.  Adding to their inherited wealth, Laurent continued his merchant trade, and soon the two were rather stupendously rich.  Before two years had passed, Evylyn gave birth to fraternal twins, a boy they named Willem Everett (after his father's 'real' name) and a girl they called Ailsa Collette.  The two were thick as theives, and because of their close relationship, the two parents remained relatively free to continue their love affair.\n\n`&White Collar, Black Hat\n`7Growing up mostly on the road, with their parents largely leaving them to their own devices, Ailsa and Willem learned to take care of each other and themselves even as their personalities began to diverge.  As soon as they were old enough to understand, the twins were told of their heritage, both real and purchased, and instructed in how to comport themselves as nobles.  Precocious and shrewd, Ailsa thought it great fun to live a life of constant trickery and deceit, while Willem took the stance of actually trying to grow into and earn the title his father bought before his birth. \n`7Though the twins never lost their otherworldly sense of or love for one another, their differing perspectives caused them to begin branching out for alternate ways to experience life.  For Willem, this meant spending more and more time with the sons and daughters of the gentry and aristocracy in every city they visited.  For Ailsa, this meant learning new and ever more crafty ways to be just barely on the wrong side of the law - never for real profit, as she had little need for the money, but mostly for the sheer fun of getting away with things.\n\n`&Great Escape\n`7For their 16th birthday, Ailsa and Willem were to be separated and have individual celebrations befitting their 'noble' stations.  Willem went with his father to the city of Cairhien to be officially presented, and as the elder child to be acknowledged as the heir to the family's titles.  Evylyn took Ailsa to Far Madding, a somewhat remote but important trading center dominated by female sensibilities, to have a proper coming out of sorts.  Though disappointed that they weren't celebrating together, the twins were not so secretly glad that they didn't have to attend the other's party, as neither sounded very enjoyable to the other.\n`7The cotillion in Far Madding ended up being a huge disappointment to Ailsa, however, as she was expected to be every inch the proper lady, and while she had the bearing and the breeding - at least in part - she was completely bored by the prospect of spending the whole night in a heavy dress parading around with stuffy nobles and their boring boy-children.

The only thing I think I'll need to change is that rather\nthan winding up in Caemlyn, he met the Band on their way there and joined them\njust a couple weeks ago.\n\nBackground as follows:\n\n     Born in the capital city of Cairhien to a washerwoman and a noble guard, Mortai grew up close enough to the Foregate to feel at home there, but far enough away that he was not inundated by the flood of life there.  As he progressed through childhood, he displayed the typical Cairhienin love for order, and while he was not so much of a solitary child that his parents worried for him, neither was he the type to seek out the attention of crowds.  Rather, he was generally a quiet, focused child, with most of the trouble he got into with his parents resulting from a particular focus being taken too far.\n     Mortai's father's position as a guard meant that he was no stranger to weapons growing up.   His father, though, displayed a typical professional soldier's attitude towards actually fighting, and the few scuffles that he got in to as an adolescent resulted in such a sound thrashing that he developed a similar, but not identical, view on the matter.  He quickly learned to either avoid fights completely, or win them so absolutely that he had no mark by which his father could guess at his activities.\n     Though his father was short, and his mother shorter, even puberty did not do enough to bring Mortai face to face with either.  Though his features turned out beautifully, his body was healthy, nimble, and as sound as anyone could have wished, by his nineteenth birthday he had reached his full adult height of just over five feet tall.\n     When, as parents often do, Mortai's father and mother decided that it was time for him to take a job somewhere and begin to actually earn his living, he started by seeking employment with the same noble that hired his father.  On simple basis of his height and build, he was turned down for that and similar jobs.  Skilled enough for most guard-work though he was, he was simply not suited for any position that hoped to avoid conflict by intimidation.  Though he made a living for a short time working in a tavern waiting tables, he despised the constant bustle of activity and people.  Thus, he almost immediately began seeking employment elsewhere, and was ecstatic when he found a potential employer.\n     The employer in question, a mercenary commander by the name of Sharic, observed that though he was far too lightly built to be much use in any defensive capacity, he was nimble and small enough to be an extremely effective scout and spy, as well as being skilled enough if it came to an actual fight to not be a complete waste of space.  Additionally, for all that he came from a good and loving family, his parents were both practical enough to have no objections to his choice of career, while he had no qualms about taking a position that promised to work for anyone with sufficient coin.  And thus, for the next few years, he was a valued part of that small team, developing some further skill with a weapon, continuing his childhood doctrine of only fighting when victory was certain.\n     Sharic died in a minor scuffle between two lords, and the second in command who stepped up to replace him was one of the front line fighters of the company, a big hearty brawler that Mortai despised on a general level, though not a personal one.  So, politely collecting the pay for the job that ended his employer's life, he bid the company farewell and sought another band to join.\n     Never finding quite as close a fit as the man who first took him in, Mortai moved from company to company, some large, some small, picking up differing skills along the way.  Though his initial training had been with a rapier and halberd, he learned to favor a mix of light weapons and unarmed combat to see him through tricky situations.\n     The turning point in Mortai's life came recently, with the Aiel attacked Cairhien.  Being in a company that had been hired to fight the invaders by a noble lord, he found himself on the wrong end of a numbers game, with allies who's loyalty was backed only by money.  The ensuing combat was the antithesis of his preferred fighting, as he had nowhere to run, no position that was superior he could take, and the overwhelming superiority was on the other side.  Attempting to flee by the rooftops of the same building he was meant to be guarding, he was nearly brought down by an Aiel shortbow, surviving only by flinging himself off the edge.  That same act which saved his life provided him with his first scar, for the wild fling off the rooftop had no time for his usual acrobatic rolling and tumbling.  Or, as proved to be the problem, for watching where he was going.  A projecting beam a story down clipped the side of his head and knocked him unconscious, sparing him the indignity of watching his native city burn.  It was not until some days after he awoke that he learned his father had been killed in the same conflict.\n     It took Mortai some weeks to fully recover from his injury, but with the Aiel occupation of Cairhien and the subsequent lack of good offensive mercenary work, he left what money he could with his mother and took off to find a position elsewhere.  Further, he finally decided that his skill with a weapon was insufficient, his inability to stand up to men averaging a foot or taller than he galling him to the point where he decided also to seek additional training in stand up combat.  Taking off to the north and west, towards the nearest major city of Tar Valon, he found himself in a land already filled with armsmen.  And though the training of a Warder appealed to him, the notion of devoting his life to a prospect he hardly knew did not.  Thus, he stayed in the fabled city of Aes Sedai for no more than a month before turning south, and making his way to Caemlyn.\n\nI apologize for formatting, copy paste is an ugly thing.\n\nMortai\n

The only thing I think I'll need to change is that rather\nthan winding up in Caemlyn, he met the Band on their way there and joined them\njust a couple weeks ago.\n\nBackground as follows:\n\n     Born in the capital city of Cairhien to a washerwoman and a noble guard, Mortai grew up close enough to the Foregate to feel at home there, but far enough away that he was not inundated by the flood of life there.  As he progressed through childhood, he displayed the typical Cairhienin love for order, and while he was not so much of a solitary child that his parents worried for him, neither was he the type to seek out the attention of crowds.  Rather, he was generally a quiet, focused child, with most of the trouble he got into with his parents resulting from a particular focus being taken too far.\n     Mortai's father's position as a guard meant that he was no stranger to weapons growing up.   His father, though, displayed a typical professional soldier's attitude towards actually fighting, and the few scuffles that he got in to as an adolescent resulted in such a sound thrashing that he developed a similar, but not identical, view on the matter.  He quickly learned to either avoid fights completely, or win them so absolutely that he had no mark by which his father could guess at his activities.\n     Though his father was short, and his mother shorter, even puberty did not do enough to bring Mortai face to face with either.  Though his features turned out beautifully, his body was healthy, nimble, and as sound as anyone could have wished, by his nineteenth birthday he had reached his full adult height of just over five feet tall.\n     When, as parents often do, Mortai's father and mother decided that it was time for him to take a job somewhere and begin to actually earn his living, he started by seeking employment with the same noble that hired his father.  On simple basis of his height and build, he was turned down for that and similar jobs.  Skilled enough for most guard-work though he was, he was simply not suited for any position that hoped to avoid conflict by intimidation.  Though he made a living for a short time working in a tavern waiting tables, he despised the constant bustle of activity and people.  Thus, he almost immediately began seeking employment elsewhere, and was ecstatic when he found a potential employer.\n     The employer in question, a mercenary commander by the name of Sharic, observed that though he was far too lightly built to be much use in any defensive capacity, he was nimble and small enough to be an extremely effective scout and spy, as well as being skilled enough if it came to an actual fight to not be a complete waste of space.  Additionally, for all that he came from a good and loving family, his parents were both practical enough to have no objections to his choice of career, while he had no qualms about taking a position that promised to work for anyone with sufficient coin.  And thus, for the next few years, he was a valued part of that small team, developing some further skill with a weapon, continuing his childhood doctrine of only fighting when victory was certain.\n     Sharic died in a minor scuffle between two lords, and the second in command who stepped up to replace him was one of the front line fighters of the company, a big hearty brawler that Mortai despised on a general level, though not a personal one.  So, politely collecting the pay for the job that ended his employer's life, he bid the company farewell and sought another band to join.\n     Never finding quite as close a fit as the man who first took him in, Mortai moved from company to company, some large, some small, picking up differing skills along the way.  Though his initial training had been with a rapier and halberd, he learned to favor a mix of light weapons and unarmed combat to see him through tricky situations.\n     The turning point in Mortai's life came recently, with the Aiel attacked Cairhien.  Being in a company that had been hired to fight the invaders by a noble lord, he found himself on the wrong end of a numbers game, with allies who's loyalty was backed only by money.  The ensuing combat was the antithesis of his preferred fighting, as he had nowhere to run, no position that was superior he could take, and the overwhelming superiority was on the other side.  Attempting to flee by the rooftops of the same building he was meant to be guarding, he was nearly brought down by an Aiel shortbow, surviving only by flinging himself off the edge.  That same act which saved his life provided him with his first scar, for the wild fling off the rooftop had no time for his usual acrobatic rolling and tumbling.  Or, as proved to be the problem, for watching where he was going.  A projecting beam a story down clipped the side of his head and knocked him unconscious, sparing him the indignity of watching his native city burn.  It was not until some days after he awoke that he learned his father had been killed in the same conflict.\n     It took Mortai some weeks to fully recover from his injury, but with the Aiel occupation of Cairhien and the subsequent lack of good offensive mercenary work, he left what money he could with his mother and took off to find a position elsewhere.

None stayed for particularly long, and as a result the child \nturned largely inward.  His studies fascinated him, and while the world around \nhim changed, books and learned provided constants he was otherwise denied.\nThis inner focus granted him both a blessing, and a curse.  The \nmatriarchal society of Far Madding never had much of an impact on a growing lad \nwho simply couldn't be bothered to look up to see who was telling him to move \nout of the way, clean his room, or otherwise attempting to break his \nconcentration.  The lack of close supervision from his parents meant no one \nparticularly noticed the trend developing until it was firmly entrenched in his \npsyche, and by then it was too late.  When Kiziel reached his teens, he was too \ndifferent for polite Far Madding society, so his family dealt with it the only \nway they could: they provided for his needs, made sure he was well fed and well \nsupplied with books, and carefully cloistered away from the outside world.\nHe barely noticed.  The exile his parents imposed, something another man \nmight consider torturous, was a boon to him, offering him the chance to devote \nhimself to further studies.  Astronomy was achieved via a telescope he \nconstructed, carefully hand grinding and polishing the glass lenses.  This got \nhim in turn interested in machines which might help automate the process the \nnext time, and he turned his studies to physics and practical mechanics.  From \nthere, his attention soon wandered away from the automated lens polishing and \ngrinding that started it, and soon the little workstation his family had \nprovided adjacent to his room was littered with prototypes and half-finished \nmachines.  The metals he had available were, however, insufficient to the tasks \nhe had in mind, lacking sufficient tensile strength to hold the precise forms \nhe required in the sizes he needed, and so again his attention shifted.  This \ntime, alchemy and metallurgy held his interest for quite some time, as he \ndevoted himself to the study of chemical reactions, purifying and refining \nmetals before remixing them.  His lab was not sufficient in size to allow him \nfull freedom to experiment - it's difficult to construct a blast furnace in a \n20x20 room, after all - but he did what he could, and his results were \nsufficient for his purposes at the time.\nHis studies continued uninterrupted, the young man meeting few enough \nservants and no one from outside the household, until sometime shortly after an \n18th birthday he somehow missed.  Taking his latest book with him out into the \ngardens to read, donning a hat to shelter his skin from the harsh sun, he found \nhimself leaning against a tree and reading until after dark.  It was then that \nthe strange girl, clad all in black, clambered over the wall and dropped down \npractically on top of him.  Though vague thoughts of assassination danced \nbriefly through his mind, Kiziel was hardly afraid - if anything, he was \nintensely curious at this sudden intrusion into his secluded world.  Young - \nyounger than he - and with skin dark enough to notice even in the dim light of \nthe single lantern he had been using to read, she presented a sudden and \nstartling reminder of the outside world.  Greeting her, the young man \nhesitantly attempted to converse with her about the metallurgic tome he was \ncurrently reading.  That fell flat, but she countered with questions of her \nown, and in time the two were conversing on a broad variety of topics, spurring \nan interest in outside discourse Kiziel had never truly known.  Further, while \nthe girl was clearly well educated - and thus probably noble - she demanded no \nmore deference than he, allowing for comfortable discourse to proceed \nnaturally.  When dawn rose, she delivered a peck to his cheek, and then fled \nover the same wall over which she came in. \nKiziel made up his mind.  The previous dawn, his bedroom, small but \noverfilled library and tiny workshop had been enough.  By the following \nevening, everything was too small, too cramped, and too limited.  He knew his \nparents wouldn't ever let him leave with their blessing - the chance that he \nwould bring shame on his family was too high, and even he had figured out what \nthey were doing by now - so instead he began planning in private.  Over the \nnext couple years, he carefully gathered supplies, using his studies as a guise \nnow while he put together some easily transported valuables.  Then, when he \nfelt he had enough, he packed his few changes of clothes and left, pack on his \nback, escaping over the same wall his strange friend had used to come in.\nFrom there, he wandered for a time.  He knew he couldn't stay in the city, \nso, recalling the girl making some mentions of Cairhien, he found himself on \nthe road headed north, his family's name getting him past the gate guards.  He \nhad traded for some supplies - foodstuffs that would keep for weeks, a bedroll, \nand some sturdier clothes, but had no horse, no weapons, and no practical \nexperience with the outside world.\nHis progress was slow, as he found himself stopping frequently to trade \nhis dwindling supplies of metals for supplies, asking for directions, never \nquite managing to learn decent horsemanship despite purchasing a placid mare to \nhelp him in his quest. \nIt took him a further year, but he made it nearly halfway to the city of \nthe Hill of the Golden Dawn before being mugged just south of Caemlyn, left \nwith the clothes on his back and little more.\nIn Caemlyn, Kiziel traded his knowledge for food.  Specifically, he found \nsmall bits of work at apothecaries, smithies, and factories, using knowledge \nand hands which were as skilled as a trained craftsman to feed himself and \neventually find a small room.  Still, he was not particularly successful in \nsaving up enough to move on towards his goal - his lack of practical, worldly \nknowledge meant that he had trouble managing what coin he made, and he often \nsuffered for a lack of practice in bargaining.\nFinally, contemplating simply giving up his quest, Kiziel was offered a \nstrange opportunity.  A band of men dressed in strange black coats, all \nwielding swords were offering a chance for any men who would take it: Be \ntested, and if able, join the most elite army of the Dragon Reborn.  The army \npart did not particularly interest the Far Madding wanderer, but the \nopportunity to talk to a channeler that, he could not pass up.  Lining up with \nseveral others, he found his questions run over roughshod, not getting the \nchance to ask any of the academic questions he had in mind, instead being sat \ndown and told to stare at a flame hovering in the air before him.\nThis part, at least, was easy.  Kiziel had never seen a man channel before \n- had never even met anyone who had claimed to meet a channeler, so the strange \nphenomenon before him captured his attention immediately.  In less than a \nminute, the older black coated man had clapped him on the shoulder and welcomed \nhim to the Dragon's forces.\nHere, he excelled.  While there were hardships, of course, a man \naccustomed to forgetting his meal until it was stone cold on a workbench nearby \nhad few objections to eating his meal cold, and someone who had passed out \nleaning against a tree with a book in his lap dozens of times found sleeping on \nthe cold earth faintly comforting, somehow.  \nRather, it was the discipline that Kiziel lacked, the sense of army \nstructure.  The One Power came to him naturally - while he would never have \nchanneled without training, his strength was immediately apparent, and the \nesoteric study of advanced weaves was to him simply an extension of the \nacademia he adored.  Indeed, some of the metallurgy that had always escaped him \nwas soon within his reach - by the time the Lord Dragon arrived to create ranks \non the Farm, he needed no blast furnace to forge quality steel, heating and \ncompressing it easily with Saidin.  His ability to follow orders was spotty, \nat times, but provided the task given to him was simple enough, he would pursue \nit with the dedication of a man devoted to making anything keeping him from his \nstudies go away.\nHe found himself a Dedicated almost from the offset, simply due to raw \nundeniable strength, but it was after the Lord Dragon observed him in a spar he \nhad been goaded into by one of Taim's Asha'man that he was awarded his second \npin.  This granted him a measure of authority he had never asked for, but also \na measure of autonomy he had been seeking for quite some time.  Finally, nearly \nseven months after joining the Asha'man, almost three years after fleeing Far \nMadding, and twenty-five years after his birth, he had the chance to travel the \nworld looking for resources, finding books he had never known existed, and \nmeeting people who might, potentially, share his interests.  True, he was asked \noccasionally to use his power for some specific task or another, being sent off \non recruiting runs since his ability to form Gates was steady and consistent, \nbut this was a fair trade for sometimes having captive audiences whose ears he \ncould talk off on one topic or another.  More than one Recruit was forced to \nendure a lesson in channeling Earth that devolved into an in depth explanation \nof metal alloys, or a lesson in Fire that ended up discussing how heat \nresistant various materials were.\nIt was perhaps a month ago that the new Asha'man found himself being \nshunted off the Black Tower grounds by a group of Taim's men who had grown \ntired of his prattling.  They did not kick him out completely, of course - he \nwas too valuable for that - but instead he found himself in a semi-permanent \nposting in Caemlyn, operating a shop that acted as a secondary base for \n

More than one Recruit was forced to \nendure a lesson in channeling Earth that devolved into an in depth explanation \nof metal alloys, or a lesson in Fire that ended up discussing how heat \nresistant various materials were.\nIt was perhaps a month ago that the new Asha'man found himself being \nshunted off the Black Tower grounds by a group of Taim's men who had grown \ntired of his prattling.  They did not kick him out completely, of course - he \nwas too valuable for that - but instead he found himself in a semi-permanent \nposting in Caemlyn, operating a shop that acted as a secondary base for \n

Restlessness makes him miserly one minute, to save enough to leave earlier, and careless the next, wasting coin because of intolerable boredom.  He passes up several opportunities to work his way east as a guard or servant.

The corner of one side of his mouth twinges, and there is an immediate coppery trickle to explore gingerly with rough fingers.\nHe discovers he is on the other side of town than his rented space, and it is a long walk back on streets that are basically channels of churned up mud, almost always crowded with men and beasts.  He loses his footing several times to avoid hooves nearly the size of his head stepping too close to his unprotected feet.

They are scattered across the ground, half in the grassy plot next to the steps and half in the mud of a narrow side street, which is cobbled high but muddied many times over by tracks off of the main streets.\nHe feels too sick to be angry, and his cursing is half-hearted.  He opens the door to go into the house and begins to ask what--? when his friends fist meets his face, knocking him back to stumble down the stairs and wobble another step further from the house, only to slip in the mud and land solidly on his back.  Very painful.  Not going to do that again.  He rolls to his side and blinks back tears.  Light burn them, is his first thought, and then since he is not a completely unreasonable young man, he thinks, what did I do? He hauls himself back on his feet and stares down at the few things he can claim.  A month of work would pay for new, but he needs boots now, for work this afternoon.  Burn them.  Burn me.  He walks out into the mud again and procures coin he has placed in a moneylenders keeping.  He buys boots.

For the youngest son of the best and most successful banker in Chachin and the best and most sought after horse trainer in Kandor, this was certainly the case.  Tiernan was the sixth and final child born to two very wealthy, very influential, very busy, and very wealthy people.  Because of their net worth, and the time it takes to build and maintain that level of wealth without being a member of the nobility, the boy's parents basically passed him off to his older brothers and sisters, along with a steady stream of nursemaids and governesses.\n\nAs it was, they were blessed with a boy who got along with everyone - he always had a cheerful demeanor and never shied away from a conversation or a new friend or a point if interest.  There was something of a curse to that blessing, because he was also undaunted and unflappable - he never shied away from a back alley card game or a practical joke or a drink with the boys.  His tutors complained regularly that he never took anything seriously, but he also never failed any test they put to him to gauge his abilities.  A charmer from the start, he could even make his sisters blush and giggle like courting girls - and he by no means stopped his practice with his sisters.  More than once Tiernan has been publicly repudiated for his quite ungentlemanly behavior with the young daughters of Chachin, but not even the threats and the yelling and the weeping women he left in his wake were enough to dissuade him from trying it again with the next pretty young thing to catch his transitory interest.\n\nHis demeanor being totally unsuited for either banking or equestrian training, the boy's parents continued their policy of "ignore him and he'll go away", but because they took at least some responsibility for his well-being, they continued providing him with an allowance which kept him in drink, cards, books, women, and general fun - and which also served to prolong his adolescence and prevent him from learning about how the real world works.\n\nWhich is why, when on vacation with a few of his closest friends, hunting far from home in the vast forests and plains north of Andor, the group of young, mostly spoiled minor nobles and other man-children decided to go to Caemlyn - on a whim.  They had a rousingly successful fortnight in the uptight capital of the large, wealthy central nation.  One night while they were out (still) drinking, a small group of black-coated men were quietly but openly accepting/requesting applicants to go join the Dragon Reborn's army of male channelers - the Asha'man.\n\nDrunk, and foolish, Tiernan and three of his closest - and drunkest - friends dared each other to take the mens' test for a lark.  Tiernan went last, and was bolstered by the failures of his buddies, each one receiving more and more good-natured jeers as they were told they would not be eligible.

For the youngest son of the best and most successful banker in Chachin and the best and most sought after horse trainer in Kandor, this was certainly the case.  Tiernan was the sixth and final child born to two very wealthy, very influential, very busy, and very wealthy people.  Because of their net worth, and the time it takes to build and maintain that level of wealth without being a member of the nobility, the boy's parents basically passed him off to his older brothers and sisters, along with a steady stream of nursemaids and governesses.\n\nAs it was, they were blessed with a boy who got along with everyone - he always had a cheerful demeanor and never shied away from a conversation or a new friend or a point if interest.  There was something of a curse to that blessing, because he was also undaunted and unflappable - he never shied away from a back alley card game or a practical joke or a drink with the boys.  His tutors complained regularly that he never took anything seriously, but he also never failed any test they put to him to gauge his abilities.  A charmer from the start, he could even make his sisters blush and giggle like courting girls - and he by no means stopped his practice with his sisters.  More than once Tiernan has been publicly repudiated for his quite ungentlemanly behavior with the young daughters of Chachin, but not even the threats and the yelling and the weeping women he left in his wake were enough to dissuade him from trying it again with the next pretty young thing to catch his transitory interest.\n\nHis demeanor being totally unsuited for either banking or equestrian training, the boy's parents continued their policy of "ignore him and he'll go away", but because they took at least some responsibility for his well-being, they continued providing him with an allowance which kept him in drink, cards, books, women, and general fun - and which also served to prolong his adolescence and prevent him from learning about how the real world works.\n\nWhich is why, when on vacation with a few of his closest friends, hunting far from home in the vast forests and plains north of Andor, the group of young, mostly spoiled minor nobles and other man-children decided to go to Caemlyn - on a whim.  They had a rousingly successful fortnight in the uptight capital of the large, wealthy central nation.  One night while they were out (still) drinking, a small group of black-coated men were quietly but openly accepting/requesting applicants to go join the Dragon Reborn's army of male channelers - the Asha'man.\n\nDrunk, and foolish, Tiernan and three of his closest - and drunkest - friends dared each other to take the mens' test for a lark.  Tiernan went last, and was bolstered by the failures of his buddies, each one receiving more and more good-natured jeers as they were told they would not be eligible.  Expecting the worst treatment of the lot, the Kandori banker's son sobers up almost immediately upon being informed that in fact he was exactly the type of man they were looking for.  Despite his protests, which somehow even he felt sounded hollow, the Asha'man insisted the results were indisputable.

High `3shelves`7, at least eight high, line the walls on either side\nof the desk.  A `3painting`7 hangs above the desk silently.

A pair of `8dark`7, form-fitting breeches reach into a pair of `8hard\nleather boots`7 which are turned down at the ankle.  Propped against the\narm of the chair are two scabbards, one shorter than the other.  In his\nhand he holds an open `6book`7 palmed along the spine.

Basically, having code guildskills available to characters in multiple guilds is unfair.  If guildskills are to be re-introduced (as specific coded GUILDskills), we need to figure out how to restrict them in a way that does not limit PC creativity (Gleeman Sedai advisor to a Queen in DD?  Sure, be in all those guilds!) but that does not reward cheesing the system (Warder-trained Aiel Wolfkin? Uh... Signal Veil Wofldream Goldeneyes?  No... thank you...)\n\nThe old guild system made it impossible to have multiple guildskills, and while I prefer allowing players to be in as many guilds at a time as they can justify, I certainly don't want people having half the guildskills in the game on one character just because they wrote a neat background.\n\n`!4) `1Imm trust.`7\n\nZach brought up the point that we, as Imms, have a lot of trust to regain with the players.  Though none of our current (active) staff has really ever abused that trust as far as I know, there is a long history of staff distrust that we have to overcome, because a lot of our players have long memories.  It isn't necessarily fair that we will be held to a standard based on the actions of previous Imms, but we will be, and missteps will serve to reinforce bad feelings on behalf of the playerbase.\n\nOvercoming this is simple, but not easy.  First and foremost, we need to say what we mean and mean what we say - basically make promises and keep them.  Secondly, we should be as transparent as possible without endangering plots or player characters.  Third, we should be clear about our boundaries: our immranks should mean what they say and we should each respect the domains of the others - Ayasha is HEAD Building and Story, and has the final say on zones and plotlines, Anazail is HEAD Shadow and has final say on Shadowy stuffs, I've got Guilds and would like final say on Human Resources - but we should all be sharing our (non-secret) stuff with each other because none of it is totally independent.\n\nFor example, and just because it's a recent one, Ayasha has complete control over who gets bookies (aside from Forsaken), but a head's up to the rest of us so we know that the bookie's taken and by whom lets us look like we're all on the same page - and lets us be prepared to include them.  Doing what we do within our own purviews shouldn't require 'permission' from the others, but we should include each other in our decisions.  So far, this has not been any kind of issue - but it is something to keep in mind, since hoarding domains caused previous Imm staffs a lot of problems with players.\n\nOK, those are the major points I wanted to bring up.

Though none of our current (active) staff has really ever abused that trust as far as I know, there is a long history of staff distrust that we have to overcome, because a lot of our players have long memories.  It isn't necessarily fair that we will be held to a standard based on the actions of previous Imms, but we will be, and missteps will serve to reinforce bad feelings on behalf of the playerbase.\n\nOvercoming this is simple, but not easy.  First and foremost, we need to say what we mean and mean what we say - basically make promises and keep them.  Secondly, we should be as transparent as possible without endangering plots or player characters.  Third, we should be clear about our boundaries: our immranks should mean what they say and we should each respect the domains of the others - Ayasha is HEAD Building and Story, and has the final say on zones and plotlines, Anazail is HEAD Shadow and has final say on Shadowy stuffs, I've got Guilds and would like final say on Human Resources - but we should all be sharing our (non-secret) stuff with each other because none of it is totally independent.\n\nFor example, and just because it's a recent one, Ayasha has complete control over who gets bookies (aside from Forsaken), but a head's up to the rest of us so we know that the bookie's taken and by whom lets us look like we're all on the same page - and lets us be prepared to include them.  Doing what we do within our own purviews shouldn't require 'permission' from the others, but we should include each other in our decisions.  So far, this has not been any kind of issue - but it is something to keep in mind, since hoarding domains caused previous Imm staffs a lot of problems with players.\n\nOK, those are the major points I wanted to bring up.  None of it is terribly urgent, though channeling would be great, I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.\n\n-R\n

Period.  \n\nPerrin is in GHEALDAN.  Miniver was lucky to have heard that Sending.  Granted,\nwolves may have spread the word of the incident, but Perrin is hunting for HIS\nKIDNAPPED WIFE.  \n\nIn the books, Perrin is obsessed with finding Faile.  If anything, he would be\nusing the wolf dream to scout out the Shaido camp, NOT some hill way far away\nsoutheast of Caemlyn.  \n\nPlease review POLICY BOOKIE.  One of the points I made there when updating that\nfile is that players who take on book characters are expected to play their\ncharacters in accordance with the characters from the books.  \n\nDo you really think Perrin would leave Faile to certain death and torture, to\ngo off chasing rumors about something else?  \n\nThe books say no.  Perrin is nearly insane with terror for what is going to\nhappen to Faile, and is very near to losing himself to the wolf.  He's so\nobsessed with it that everything else is secondary.  \n\nFinally, like I said, I am going to be running a very large event JUST FOR\nPERRIN.  I am going through a lot of trouble to do so.  Please be patient, and\nyou'll reap the rewards.  We will get Perrin on the grid eventually.  But you\ncan't violate our policies by having two alts involved in the same storyline,\nand doing something that would be out of character for Perrin.  \n\nI'm sorry if I'm getting upset, but you just don't seem to understand, and I\ndon't know how to get through to you.  \n\nThis is the final word on the matter.  Perrin cannot be involved in the\ninvestigation of the hill.  Miniver is more than welcome to investigate in TAR\nwith Wyl and Ragnarr, and whoever else you want.  But not Perrin.  \n\n\nAyasha\n

Now under-armed, several noble Houses have sent feelers through Cairhien and beyond, trying to tempt new men-at-arms to come off the account and don House colors.\n`\nWith this comes new whispers.  A few who pay attention to such matters have started ruminating aloud that a substantial number of men who have abandoned their posts seem largely to have been those who had previously been affiliated with the disgraced Andoran militia known as the White Lions. Some say those men are hoping to let bygones be bygones now that matters in Andor have settled down somewhat, and have simply gone home. Others still say it is merely happenstance, and that the Cairhienin Houses simply couldn't offer to pay as much as what the young Queen of Andor is offering to boost her numbers - after all, it is not solely former White Lions who have left the Houses half-unguarded.\n`\nWhatever the case, it is no longer debatable that men-at-arms are likely to find hearty welcome among the City of the Rising Sun's decadent Houses.\n

A few who pay attention to such matters have started ruminating aloud that a substantial number of men who have abandoned their posts seem largely to have been those who had previously been affiliated with the disgraced Andoran militia known as the White Lions. Some say those men are hoping to let bygones be bygones now that matters in Andor have settled down somewhat, and have simply gone home. Others still say it is merely happenstance, and that the Cairhienin Houses simply couldn't offer to pay as much as what the young Queen of Andor is offering to boost her numbers - after all, it is not solely former White Lions who have left the Houses half-unguarded.\n`\nWhatever the case, it is no longer debatable that men-at-arms are likely to find hearty welcome among the City of the Rising Sun's decadent Houses.\n

They stopped and talked with several groups of all sort of people.  Young and old, men and women, all those traveling or idling in groups of more than three at a time.

Any time someone stopped them, they spoke with the questioner until he/she was satisfied of whatever answers they gave, and then moved on.  Rarely did they stay in one place and longer than the course of a conversation.\n\n\nNeither of them ever made an angry or violent move toward anyone, they were completely calm and polite to everyone they spoke with, and they did not antagonize the men sent to follow them.  When they stopped for food, the younger of the two even gestured toward them apparently offering to buy them some, which your men declined.\n\nAbout two hours after sundown, when most people were no longer on the streets, the two men made for the east gate.  They had stabled horses near the city entrance, and they retrieved the mounts - the only time they went inside a building of any sort - and rode out of town at a steady trot.  They traveled along the road heading east until your men felt it prudent to head back to town: at least twenty minutes' gentle ride from the gate.\n

His coat is red with scrolling dragons upon the sleeves.  At his\nwaist is a crystalline sword.  The man is the Dragon Reborn and it is only through\nhim that both Towers can, at last, find a peace.  \n

Despite not being in full control of his mental faculties when he chose to join the Hunt, Jondrim decided he would honor this Oath.  He had already been theorizing that the Horn had most likely already been found and was on display in the foyer of some noble that had no idea what it was as an antique.  Though Gos and Laskon had not sworn the oath, they agreed that Jondrim's theory was just as likely as anything else and that it would fit to the plans they had already made.  \nAnd so they followed their plans.  The trio spent the next six months heading eastward towards Tear and eventually ending in Godan. Jondrim spent that time growing his hair and beard out in the style of several nations as he pretend to be a noble of anywhere from Arad Doman to Ghealdan.

Given the feisty nature of the Altaran nobles and the lack of rumors regarding collections of antiquities they decided to move onward without attempting any further "work".   From there they sold half of their remaining emeralds and took passage on another ship towards Tanchico with the thought that others in the country may have taken inspiration from the Panarch's Palace and begun collecting antiquities.  \nWhile some of the Taraboner nobles the group managed to worm their way into the confidences of did have some small collections the Horn was no where in sight nor was there any credible rumors off of its location.  Still, there was gold to be had and the three made their way across Tarabon before cutting through Amadacian and Ghealdan.  Where the River Manetherelle skirts the border of Murandy they boarded a river boat sailing upstream towards Whitebridge and their group had its first tragedy.\nThey had had a few attempts at theft go bad and had had to flee, but in general the last year of Jondrim's life had been rather care free, exciting and a real adventure.  He had kept up on his swordsmanship, reading every book and treatise on the subject as well as histories and books of prophecy he could find thinking that they may hold some hint to the Horns location.  From Gos he had learned to play the bittern well enough to impress most people, though like with the sword he was no master.  On his own he had picked up the ability to mimic the mannerisms and accents of nearly all the lands of west through careful observation of those around him and practice.  In short, he felt like he was living a story out of some Gleeman's tale, but in those the heroes rarely die.  The crossbow bolt in Gos's chest changed all that.\nTheir boat was set upon by river bandits one night when they were nearly a week out from White Bridge.  The boat had been anchored near shore and Gos had been on deck smoking his pipe when a volley of arrows and bolts flew into the ship before more bandits in boats suddenly rushed the ship.  Gos had been unlucky enough to have been sillouted by the lantern behind him and proved an easy target for the archers on shore and proved to be one of the few causilities of the attack.  In addition to Gos, Jondrim and Laskon the ship had taken on a company of experienced mercenaries as passengers and where the bandits had been expecting a score of sailors at most to deal with they were instead quickly beaten off by veteran soldiers.\nWhen they arrive in White Bridge Laskon and Jondrim decided to go their seperate ways.  While the two had grown into friends over the last year, Gos had truly been the glue that had held the group together and in his absence it fell apart.  Without Gos they would not be able to pull of their usual ruse and so they split what wealth they had and said their good byes.  Laskon went westward towards Baerlon to meet up with some assoicates of his while Jondrim joined with the mercenaries from the ship and headed east towards Caemlyn.\nOver the next few months Jondrim travelled eastward, doing bits of soldiering with his new companions before breaking away from them in Aringill to go his own way.  There had been not further rumors of the horn to reach his ears, but he still thought the answer laid with in either a noble's parlor or some rare lines of text in a book.. and so he head towards Cairhien.\n

Without Gos they would not be able to pull of their usual ruse and so they split what wealth they had and said their good byes.  Laskon went westward towards Baerlon to meet up with some assoicates of his while Jondrim joined with the mercenaries from the ship and headed east towards Caemlyn.\nOver the next few months Jondrim travelled eastward, doing bits of soldiering with his new companions before breaking away from them in Aringill to go his own way.  There had been not further rumors of the horn to reach his ears, but he still thought the answer laid with in either a noble's parlor or some rare lines of text in a book.. and so he head towards Cairhien.\n

Aludra has knowledge and experience\nwith fireworks.  \n\nResources: An Illuminator living in my camp.  Well-funded by both gambling and\nnow the Queen of Andor.  Access to bellfounders.  Ta'veren.  \n\nPlan: Most of the testing has already been done in the books, since it's\nbasically taking a firework launching tube and launching a firework.  Aludra is\nsimply expanding on that idea and adding more powder and making the firework\nitself larger.  There will be testing on various amounts of powder for the\ndistances we are wanting, as well as field tests in aiming.

Aludra has knowledge and experience\nwith fireworks.  \n\nResources: An Illuminator living in my camp.  Well-funded by both gambling and\nnow the Queen of Andor.  Access to bellfounders.  Ta'veren.  \n\nPlan: Most of the testing has already been done in the books, since it's\nbasically taking a firework launching tube and launching a firework.  Aludra is\nsimply expanding on that idea and adding more powder and making the firework\nitself larger.  There will be testing on various amounts of powder for the\ndistances we are wanting, as well as field tests in aiming.
