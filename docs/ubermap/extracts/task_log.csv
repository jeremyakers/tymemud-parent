1,25,Needed: Sittable Objects,"This is a list Duren gave me of things which would have to be updated in order to complete this task.

Duren:
At a high level, we need:  
*Two new object flags.  
*We need two new linked lists on objects, one to store players who are sitting on an object, and another to store objects that are sitting on an object.  
*We need to modify the 'sit' command to allow sitting 'on' something. 
*We need to modify the 'put' command to allow putting stuff on other things.  
*We have to modify commands like 'look', to make them display people or objects that are sitting on an object.  
*And then we have to deal with code that expects all objects to be either in the room, or in an object in the room.  All of that code will have to be modified to now search -on- objects as well as -in- objects. ",6,0,01/28/2008 00:21:38,,0,0,NULL

I have a list of about 30 or so pieces of EQ on my computer that I never put in because I was told EQ should be built after we finalize numbers, hit/dam, etc.

So, craft code should be considered nearly complete and bug tested. :D

Chairs cannot have other objects or players on top of them if a player wishes to sit on it.

do_sit, do_rest, do_sleep where they concerns objects will accept an <on> arg, example: both 'sit on object'
and 'sit object' will work the same for all three commands.

The same three commands will tell the player they can't sit/rest/sleep on the object in the event that the obj
