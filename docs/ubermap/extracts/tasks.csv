When we load an object, we should just point the pointers at the existing strings in memory.  This would reduce memory consumption as well as storage space and SQL query overhead.We probably shouldn't be saving extra descriptions at all.  As far as I know they can not be customized outside of OLC, so why not just load the ex-desc from the OLC prototype instead of saving 5,000 copies of the same damn map of Cairhien?And then last but not least, and save/load code that issues multiple SQL statements in a row should use Saga's query concatenation code to combine them into one very large query to reduce the query overhead.Rule:  ALL QUERIES should be using sqlQuery, and should -always- check the return value from sqlQuery before calling mysql_store_result, because if you call mysql_store_result after sqlQuery returns an error, it will crash the mud.  Always insert some sort of syserr in the if-check block to log message about a database problem.  syserr automatically records the source code file and line number to make tracking down the problem easier.Rule:  No more DELETE/INSERT or REPLACE queries.  If a record already exists, UPDATE it.  If no record exists, insert it, but do not try to run a DELETE before hand.DELETE/INSERT combo's and REPLACE statements cause problems with referential integrity checks.
