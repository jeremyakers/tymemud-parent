3417	2004-02-11 12:21:31	Nicodemus	`@C`2ode `@C`2ombat`7	0	0	3417	1076525522	Hey, all.  Given all the neat things we learned from MM3 about how not to implement\nlarge projects, I'm generally conservative in how much we discuss projects once\nthey'v moved past the conceptual phase and are actually being coded.  However,\nit's been brought to our attention that some misconceptions are circulating\nregarding combat, so I'm going to post some general information to clear things\nup.\n\n`6What's combat going to be like?`7\n\n   Firstly, combat is going to be a form and skill based system again, with\n   emphasis on balancing IC realism and customizable gameplay.  The grid\n   is gone, since it was unpopular and caused enormous problems with retainers\n   and mobs and multiple groups fighting each other.  It has three major\n   settings with varying degrees of speed and user interaction.  All settings\n   allow for users to adjust how their character fights at any time prior to,\n   or during combat.  They range from manual (similar to turn based combat,\n   for those few players who want something to supplement their emotes in an\n   emote fight) to automatic, which is quick and doesn't hang on waiting\n   for players to input commands.  For policy purposes, priority goes to the\n   fastest setting (manual, semi-auto or automatic) of any combatant, so\n   that when someone starts supermanning to the point of being ridiculous,\n   a more senior combatant can once again say 'eff this' and pkill the\n   bugger in short order.  Provided that legal RP leads up to a pkill, we'll\n   be enforcing it as an IC death, as we did in MM2.\n\n`6Does this mean we're getting away from determining levels from RPing?`7\n\n   No.  You do not have to run around killing mobs as a prerequisite to\n   having a decent pfile.  Levels will still be determined through RP, and\n   code power will still be determined largely by RP and RP ability.  We're\n   just adding more ways to represent a character's abilities, and some of\n   them (such as combat skills) can be increased by use.  The emphasis is\n   still on RP, but you will definitely benefit from taking part in code\n   combat with mobs and other players.  And obviously, the more code combat\n   you're involved in, the better your character gets at it.\n\n`6What's changing?`7\n\n   We're bringing back options that allow you to control your style and how\n   much you're exerting yourself.  The code also tracks the number and types\n   of wounds to bodyparts, such that the wounds you take hamper your ability\n   to fight.  A character's combat status includes a number of new, more IC\n   fields, although this info is presented to players in a more general\n   fashion than the complicated number-tracking that the code handles.  You\n   can eventually pass out and/or die from losing blood over one good stab\n   wound even if your HPs are still high, pass out from fatigue, and walk\n   away with wounds that heal over time (or kill you later) and that can be\n   healed with channeling or first-aid skills.  If your right arm is numb or\n   broken, it makes it kinda hard to hit people, and if your sword hand is\n   miserably gashed up, you won't be able to wield your weapon effectively.\n   The entire system is based on mods, though, so it's rarely as simple as\n   saying 'your leg is broken, so now you are barred from doing this and\n   this'.  There's a chance you can pull almost anything off at any time,\n   even if you hurt yourself trying.  It's a system of critical hits and\n   a lot of mods and as much realism as we can cram into it while still\n   enhancing gameplay, instead of making the system unwieldy and confusing.\n\n   We'll also be recalculating things like stats and HPs, since currently\n   they're not really relative to anytihng concrete, and, IMO, are kinda\n   stupid.  25 strength means what, exactly? Nobody's code stats represent\n   their IC characters anymore, so we're endeavoring to fix that.  Combat\n   will be much more realistic than just keeping track of the number of\n   time you can get stabbed before you die, and deals with a lot more than\n   simple HP totals (which are now mainly just invisible benchmarks for\n   other calculations).\n\n`6Bah, I liked Turn Based Combat.  Lets just finish that, shall we?`7\n\n   Once we get the skeleton system (meaning a fully running combat system\n   but without all of the details we've laid the foundation for), code\n   combat will be brought in.  We will continue adding to it extensively\n   as we go.  If you've got any questions/comments, feel free to ask.\n   We're gonna get real grouchy real fast if anybody says 'this sucks,\n   lets keep TBC' tho.\n\nAlso, Fredrik rocks.\n\nLastly, no proofreading took place at any time on this.  It's not that\nNico doesn't know how to type, it's that he just doesn't care. *sage*\n\n-Nico, Duren and Fredrik, the Man\n

If I can figure out a way\n   to make some system of one or two exception slots or something\n   that won't screw econ up, we can do that, too.  For the moment\n   though, I'd think of this more like code toys - fun stuff that's\n   cool and personalized.  All the imms want lightsabers (big\n   surprise).  I dunno what kind of ideas you guys have - for me,\n   I'd probably want a one-of-a-kind Seafolk lantern that self-\n   tools and something else for my hold slot.\n\n   I dunno - if this doesn't make sense to you guys, I'll explain\n   real quick how the lightsabers work.  There's an object in\n   the imm zone called a lightsaber - its description is "===.="\n   when you load one.  When you activate it, everybody in the room\n   hears it, you get a message and the object retools itself\n   into ===.=------------------, except in color and the blade\n   has the background color around each dash as well as the bright\n   color.  I'm on raw telnet so I'm not gonna try it here :p But\n   maybe that'll give you guys some ideas.\n\n   -Nico\n

Instead of having cities\n   connected by tedious, looping trails that are sometimes hundreds\n   of rooms long, the cities we know and love are being placed where\n   they belong on a fully traversable, fully built continent.  Now that\n   the coding is done, what we need is a few more volunteers (we already\n   have a group) to help write better descs for the areas of the\n   continent that surround RP hotspots, like Caemlyn and Tar Valon.\n   This is not exactly building, since all the hard stuff in classic\n   building has been finished.  The last step is to write better descs\n   for these rooms - things like the roads that connect cities, and\n   the countryside around cities.  If you're willing to join in and help\n   us flesh out Randland, please see Syrah or myself and we'll set you\n   up.  Thanks!\n\n   -Nico, who got woken up this morning for a 'mud emergency' :p\n

So.. welcome to the new map. :p If you want to see what\n   it looks like, the map and some explanation is posted at:\n   `^http://www.engr.umd.edu/~maeillo/index2.htm`7\n\n   Right now, Caemlyn, Tar Valon, Cairhien, Alindaer, Aringill, and some guild\n   areas and the connecting roads/countryside are online, but outside of that\n   big triangle, everything is not accessible to players just yet.  It's all\n   there, but it's going to be an ongoing process to enable these zones one-by-\n   one.  Syrah is the main POC for stuff that's missing, so if you want to know\n   why you can't find your house, see her and she'll fix it.  This was a pretty\n   major deal, so doubtless we missed some things.  The idea is that we'll\n   continue to re-add popular zones from MM2 and MM3 as we go.  In most cases,\n   this won't take too long, but it will take a couple of volunteers.  If you're\n   interested, please see Syrah.\n\n   A huge thank you to those of you that helped with the Ubermap - I'll probably\n   try and document who did what but for right now I'll just say a special thanks\n   to Maelyn, who redid the entire island of Tar Valon in accordance with the\n   zoomed-in map in one of the books.  I'm a huge fan of the Ogier Grove there,\n   which was courtesy of Phaedra, and I believe Sadren did the surrounding\n   countryside around TV, along with Nenae, who did Caemlyn.  I did the woods\n   north of Caemlyn.  Also, a special thanks to Lucardo, who's original idea for\n   a 'mini-continent-map that we can move armies around on' grew into this\n   ridiculously huge thing we've got here today.  It has a lot of things that\n   need to be filled in, but it allows us to do all kinds of things with the\n   combat code that we could never have done with the old map.  Picture laying\n   seiges to cities by actually surrounding the entire city with army mobs,\n   or trying to sneak your own armies across huge borders into enemy nations.\n\n   Hope you enjoy.  Since the recall functions will no longer work for some\n   locations, we imms will be happy to trans you where you need to go.\n\n   -Nic\n
4909	2006-10-01 18:21:27	Nicodemus	Update	0	0	4906	1159745078	   We're in the process of enabling zones that we need that either didn't come\n   through for whatever reason or that we didn't bring through with the first\n   batch.  Player houses are halfway there, and the missing ubermap zones are\n   enabled on the BP.  I need to do some of the guild areas, and when they're all\n   on the BP correctly, I'll port the whole thing over at once.\n\n   Before anybody else tries, due to a row of missing zones, it is currently not\n   possible to walk between all of the cities - ask for a trans if you need one.\n   I've readded the zones on the BP but we need to hook the exits up.  They'll\n   be brought in at the same time as the houses and the SC guild area, and whatever\n   other areas people speak up about.\n\n   -Nico/Jake\n

The Asha'man guild area needs to be reinstated\nalone with the recall point.  The Council's guild area, along with the Queen's \nPalace and the Halls of Justice is missing.  The Council's guild area may be difficult\nto reconnect, given the fact that its central room connects to others across the city\nthe Oval Plaza and the Barracks to name 2.\n\nAnyway, thats all I can think of right now, other than the strip of zones separating \nCairhien and Tar Valon from Caemlyn.  At the moment, there is no way for a player\nto reach the shining walls, save for being transferred there by an Imm.\n
4927	2006-10-10 20:25:37	Jake	Upgrade #2	0	0	4908	1160530177	   I've replaced the missing row of zones and placed markers for\n   all the roads, even though many of the road-rooms still have\n   default descs.  For ease of use, once you start traveling on\n   a road, the two directions that the road goes in are highlighted\n   in the title, so you can walk pretty fast without having to\n   read the desc or without accidently wandering off the trail.\n   I think we may rename some of the roads so they include the\n   names of the cities at either end instead of the bookish way\n   we've named them here (it gets confusing - to me, anyway).\n\n   At any rate, you can now walk from Caemlyn to Tar Valon to\n   Cairhien to Aringill and just about anywhere in between.\n   Obviously there's still lots to be done (like placing the\n   rest of the rivers and descripting more rooms), but this\n   is the general layout.  Also, Syrah has brought over the rest\n   of the housing zones, so those should be good to go now, too.\n\n   -Nico\n

With\nthe goal of fixing some things that are broken, stupid, or just hard for players,\nwe're making some large-scale adjustments.  The result is, we hope, that our\nguilds (for both current and hopefully future members) will be in a better\nposition to interact with each other.  Some large-scale auths are involved, and\nI don't expect everybody will like them.  I feel they are good solutions, and\neven though the implementation is a little premature, it worked out ok for the\nubermap and plus it's going to be harder if we wait until we have more players.\nHere goes.\n\nThrough act of Luc and I, Altara has fallen to the SC, and the country of\nMurandy is all but won.  Northern Altara is under contention from the DS and\nWhitecloaks.  Ghealdan remains home to the Dragonsworn (even though we don't\ncurrently have any), and the WC still control Amadicia.  Murandy's fall will\nbe presented through updates in the immediate future (its fall is imminent).\nBecause of the effort it took to conquer Altara and Murandy, the SC will be\nforced to spend a long time regrouping and gathering their resources,\nwhich will allow for more actual RP instead of aggressive attacks into\nCaemlyn.  The end result of all this is that the SC are in a position to\nimpact the RP of the 'actual' part of the mud, and the WC and DS (should we\nget any) will be in an RP hotspot, as will anybody in Caemlyn.  If you\ncheck your maps, players can still travel freely between Caemlyn and Illian,\nand the Whitecloaks can still get between Amadicia and Caemlyn, provided they\nmake it through the DS troops.  The SC will almost certainly be sending recon\nmissions into Caemlyn, and it's up to everybody to react as they like.\n\nLucardo and Parol are updating the war rules based on the ubermap grid.\nSince that grid is implemented now, we should have an improved ability to\nwage wars over this, should the RP require any.\n\nThanks! Have a nice day.\n-Nicodemus, heavy-handed imp\n
4935	2006-10-18 20:04:24	Jerod	1	0	0	4933	1161222701	I say this because, while it has been pointed out that Murandy was\nweak, and therefore an easy target, it also stands as buffer\nbetween the Seanchan and Andor.  This means that one of the\nstrongest states in Randland has no direct connections to Seanchan\nland, and is not 'threatened' by them yet, thus will more than \nlikely hesitate to consider them a threat upon which action is\nnecessary.  With the elimination of Amadicia instead, they have\nboth closed a gap in their lines, as well as having eliminated one\nof the more dangerous threats to their flank.  \n\nTaking Altara and Amadicia would then leave them with only one\nflank in danger from an appreciable enemy, that is to say Illian.\nWhereas, this attack on Murandy, rather than Amadicia has left\nthem with an appreciable threat on three fronts, as well as a less\norganized force on a fourth front.  A move that I think many would \nconsider dangerous.\n\n\nI realize that the choices made in this case were for the benefit\nof RP, rather than strategy, a way to introduce Seanchan to \nCaemlyn so that they could RP.  I would put forth however that \nmore likely this will lead to RP that will end badly for those who\nchoose to play Seanchan.  My reason for saying this is thus, with\nMurandy between Andor and Seanchan held territories, there was no\npercieved direct threat, and thus Seanchan scouts would not be in\ndirect danger simply for being in Caemlyn.  With Seanchan\nencroaching on Andoran borders, and refugees entering the city,\nanyone who is connected with the Seanchan will be considered as a\ndirect threat to the Crown the moment they step into the country,\nand will be treated as such by the authorities.  This will lead to\nimprisonment at best for those discovered(Seanchan are not \nunrecognizable), and death for most who are caught as spies.\n\nI have some other problems regarding the planned RP and the\ncharacters who will be involved in our city, but those are\npersonal issues that I can explain if you ask me directly.\n\nAnyway, these are my thoughts,\nJerod\n\nPS This should be first:\nIf this has not been already taken for IC, I feel the need to say \nthat I have a problem with this plan from an OOC standpoint.\nStrategically, this move doesn't make sense to me.\n\n

5690	2010-04-15 18:14:23	Ayasha	`#Building Needs`7	0	0	5690	1271374659	Hiya all,\n\nSorry I've been away so long.  Been dealing with some RL \nissues.  Things are back on track again now, so I should be available \nmore often if anyone needs me for anything.  I'm usually here in the \nevenings between 6 pm to Midnight CST and on the weekends.  I'd still \nlike to see this game come back to life, and will be starting work on \nmy building projects again.  If anyone wants to help with building \nprojects, please let me know.  Here is a list of what needs to be done:\n\n\n`5Mobprogs`7 - We need people willing to learn how to do mobprogs to make \nautomated quests for players to do while the player base is low.  These \nquests could offer such things as teaching skills, scavenger hunts, mobs \nthat have different reactions to characters based on who they are, etc.  \nThese are very important for us right now, because it will give something \nto players to do while we await the finishing of the new combat system.\n\n`2Ubermap`7 - There are a lot of rooms that need to be desced on the Ubermap.  \nThe Ubermap is basically a nearly-to-scale map of the area between Tar \nValon, Cairhien and Andor according to RJ's maps in the books.  Every \nsquare of it is going to be open for players to explore, and it will be \nimportant to pay attention to room descriptions in order to figure out \nwhere you are.  We need people who are willing to just do descriptions.  \nThe rooms are already set up.  We'll give you access to the Ubermap, and \nthen you can desc your heart out.  Must be willing to do mundane things\nlike forests, rivers, fields, farmlands, hills, etc. though of course\nyou're welcome to add interesting things such as bridges or other cool\nlandmarks here and there to help folks find their way around.  The Uber-\nmap is currently only 15 percent complete so we really need help with it.\n\n`3Cairhien`7 - Cairhien needs to be gone over with a fine-tooth comb to\nmake sure all the rooms connect properly.  The Sun Palace is also in\nneed of revamping, as it apparently has stairs that go nowhere.  Also,\nthere are a number of shops that are not linked to the Cairhien grid\nany longer and those need to be re-linked.  Any player interested in \nhelping out with Cairhien, please let me know and this project will be \ndelegated out.  Cairhien is currently about 75 percent complete\n\n`1Caemlyn`7 - This is again where mobprogs come in.  We want to make some\nnewbie-friendly quests for new players to get to know their way around\nand to generally make Caemlyn a more fun place to explore.  Some descs\nof rooms could probably be revamped as well.  This project is only about \n10 percent finished.\n\nThings I am Finishing:\n\n`6Non-Combat Eq`7 - I am currently going over all the wearable items and\nmaking sure that they don't have any typos and things like that.  This\nis about 50 percent done and will likely be finished in the next month.\n\n`&White Tower`7 - The White Tower is nearly complete, about 90 percent.  Just need \nto put in a few more automated quests/mobprogs, finish the basement area \nand need to finish the Warder Tower.  Elaida's Palace is nearly complete.  \nA maze has been added to the gardens.  I will be finishing the White Tower \narea hopefully in the next month, if not sooner.\n\n`!Shops`7 - Once the non-combat equipment is created and proofread, shops need \nto be made and/or edited in Caemlyn and Tar Valon (and eventually Cairhien \nonce it's relinked again) so that players can purchase the new equipment. \nThere will be shops dedicated specifically to newbie equipment, and shops \ndedicated to various equipment slots.  This project has not yet been\nstarted.\n\nSo there you have it.  My Building Report.  I would appreciate help from anyone\nwho cares to assist.  There is still much to be done, but as you can see, we know\nwhat needs to be done.  We just need to do it. :)\n\nAyasha\nHead Builder/Storyteller\n

Hadren is the PC\nowner, and Emilie is the PC 'head barwench'.  If you are RPing at the\nCompany and neither Hadren nor Emilie are around, there are two NPCs\nwho are the consistent helpers that have a full RP history within the\nCompany.

Talkative and friendly, quick and\nvery good at her job, she is the "second best barmaid in Caemlyn";\nonly Emilie boasts better abilities.  Kindra is also engaged to a \nyoung Andoran so while she will happily flirt with all the men who\ncatch her eye, she is a good girl and does not tolerate misbehavior.\n`\nIn addition, the Company prides itself on being a warm, inviting, and\nfriendly place to be.  Fights are not tolerated, nor are aggravated\ndrunks.  Unwanted advances on the barmaids are treated very harshly,\nand regulars are more than willing to toss someone out on his ear\nif the stern warnings from the barmaids don't suffice. The kitchen\nmakes fantastic meat pies and the Company prizes the reviews saying\nthey have the best ale in the city.\n`\nEveryone is welcome, provided they behave and enjoy themselves.\n`\nPlease come to the Merry Company for all your Inn RP needs. :)\n`\nHadren and Emilie\n

When I came here, way way back when (pretty sure there were dinosaurs roaming about)\nI witnessed for the first time a fight in the oval plaza between the DS and the WC. I was just shocked. There was Uno in \nthe face of some WC's face, screaming prophecies at him and all out challenging him to do something. The Queen's Guard got\ninvolved and wow, it was on. Gedarien spotted me and grabbed me and icly escorted me out of the situation.\n\nThen I saw Mat and I just flipped, but then he winked at my character and I was caught. \n\nI remember the Battle of Caemlyn when the blight marched on the north wall, destroyed the tinker camp and we had a 13th \nWarrior style epic battle. \n\nI remember when any player in any place was somehow involved, even if they didn't know it, in a Daes or Shadow plot.\n\nBut then life came and started stealing people to it. Slowly, one by one, things happened. MUD drama, RL, etc. And then\none day even I stepped away because I had to. \n\nI was told by Jezz that Tyme was back, so I logged in.

I had been a fan of roleplaying\nfor several years.  But I did not know that this place, A Moment\nin Time, existed.  I played on a MUSH for a while, Tales of Ta'veren.\n\n\nThen I found this place in 1997.  I got sucked into the drama\nalmost at once.  My very first character was a young woman by\nthe name of Taisha.  A sul'dam in disguise by the name of Rynn\nfound her channeling, killing some chickens in Caemlyn, back in\nthose days when you could still level up by killing things, and all\nchanneling was considered IC.  Something I wasn't aware of, as a noob.\nThe sul'dam stuffed her in a chest, and carted her off to\nTanchico, to learn to be a damane.  That was my first character, and I\nfell in love with the Seanchan.  So I created another character,\nOrathea Bandrac.  She became a General in the Ever Victorius Army,\nhelping to usher in the Return.\n\nMy third character was a little street urchin named Matty.  I remember\nwhen I created her, because the first day she hit the streets, she\nwas swept up in Plots.\n\nNobles wanted to adopt her.  The Queens Guards wanted to protect her from\nthe evil Whitecloaks.  Forsaken wanted to terrify her.  Other nobles wanted\nto use her, later, when she grew up and became Matylena.  She helped in the\nrise and fall of a Cairhienin King by the name of Justarius, all\nin an effort to avenge the death of the Lady Diana, to whom Maty had\nbeen a most loyal Lady-in-Waiting.\n\nMaty was a special character for me.  She was hated by Forsaken (and\nloved by one of them!).  She was a thorn in the side of Aes Sedai.\nShe nearly got one of her toes cut off by Suzanne Sedai in one of\nShai'tan's bubbles of Evil.  (Who recalls scary Suzanne Sedai??)\n\nI was many things on this game.  Maria the Gleeman from Cairhien.\nCalliandre Sedai of the Brown Ajah, who was the very first female\nTai Sedai.  Elayne Trakand.  Shalayne Sedai of the Bl... White Ajah. Tuon\nAthaem Kore Paendrag, Daughter of the Nine Moons.  Nynaeve.  Min.  I was\nalso Moiraine during the big wipe that ended Tyme as well knew it.\nThat was an epic battle, with everyone channeling everywhere, killing\neach other in an epic Tarmon Gai'don that makes A Memory of Light\nseem like a pale shadow as Storms of Air and Rolling Rings of Earth\nand Fire decimated swaths of PCs, billowing throughout Caemlyn and\neven the newbie area and the recall room.  Mortals tried to kill\nImms, and the Imms laughed at us all and used the Slay command liberally.\nIt was grand.\n\nI was also an Imm.  I remember when I first became an Imm.  Pel, Dini\nand Mikki pulled me into the Gods' Meeting Room, and accused me\nvery harshly of... doing some VERY bad things.  I was mortified and\nfurious!  There was no way I could have done what they said I did!\nThen they were all like, "Just kidding!  Pick an Imm name!"  And\nthen I joined their mean little diabolical family as Ameera.  :)\n\nI really miss this place.  But I cherish the memories.  I love you all.\nI'm sorry I had to leave, but it all became too much for me in the end\nwith my surgery and everything else.  I'm glad to see that there are\nstill people here, reminiscing.  I'm still maintaining the A Moment\nin Tyme Facebook page though.  Sometimes I post things there, especially\nconcerning the Wheel of Time movie stuff.  That's what made me log in,\nand take a look, and see what's going on.\n\nThere are far too many memories here to mention them all. But I\nsuppose I am especially grateful to Justarius, Lucrezia, Sergei, Diana,\nAsandir, Ty'marin, Mat/Acral, Sadren, Rissa, Kinje, Aethis, Milar, Zehava,\nSavren, and of course, Duren for all his hard work in keeping this place\nup and running when it could have easily been lost in Tyme.\n\nLove,\n\nAyasha\n
