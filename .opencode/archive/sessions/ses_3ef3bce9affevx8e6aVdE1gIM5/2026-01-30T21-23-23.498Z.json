        "text": "The Wheel of Time is a high fantasy epic by Robert Jordan (1948-2007), comprising 14 novels published 1990-2013, with Brandon Sanderson finishing the final three after Jordan's death.\n\n**Core Cosmology**\nThe Wheel of Time has seven spokes, each representing an Age. It weaves the Pattern of existence using souls (the Wheel's threads) who are reborn throughout ages. Time is cyclical—the same souls, events, and choices repeat across Ages. The Dark One exists outside the Pattern, seeking to break the Wheel and end all existence.\n\n**The Breaking & The Dragon**\n3,000 years before the main series, male Aes Sedai went mad when the Dark One tainted saidin, causing the Breaking of the World. Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon, was a male Aes Sedai who tried to reseal the Dark One. Reborn souls from that era, including the Dragon Reborn, are central to the series.\n\n**The Pattern's Central Conflict**\nThe Dragon Reborn (Rand al'Thor) is prophesied to either save or destroy the world. He must face the Dark One at Tarmon Gai'don (the Last Battle). Rand channels saidin (tainted by the Dark One), which slowly drives men mad.\n\n**Major Factions**\n- **Aes Sedai**: Women who channel saidar, organized in the White Tower in Tar Valon. Ranked from Novice to Accepted to full Sister. They manipulate global politics but face distrust, especially after the Breaking.\n- **The White Tower**: Fractured during the series by the Black Ajah (dark friends within) and Elaida's coup against Siuan Sanche.\n- **The Aiel**: Desert warriors descended from Da'shain Aiel, who served Aes Sedai before the Breaking. Clans include the Ta'veren, etc. They follow the Three-Fold Way (Song, Dance, Spear) and value clan loyalty above all.\n- **Asha'man**: Male channelers organized by Mazrim Taim, created to counter the Shadow. They face the same madness taint.\n- **The Forsaken**: 13 powerful channellers sealed with the Dark One, gradually freed throughout the series. Notable ones include Demandred, Moridin, Lanfear, Moghedien, and Rahvin.\n- **Seanchan**: Continent-spanning empire across the Aryth Ocean, ruled by an Empress. They use damane (captured female channelers on leashes called a'dam) and conquered parts of the Westlands.\n- **Children of the Light**: Zealous anti-Dark One organization that persecutes Aes Sedai and anyone they deem dark friends. Led by the Lord Captain Commander, currently Pedron Niall, then later whitecloaks like Galad Damodred.\n- **Shadowspawn**: Various creatures created by the Dark One including Trollocs (animal-human hybrids), Myrddraal (eyeless, blade-wielding shade), and gholam (immune to most weapons).\n\n**The Power (True Source)**\n- **Saidin**: Male half, tainted during the Breaking. Cleaner to touch but drives men mad.\n- **Saidar**: Female half, pure and gentle. Women can sense it and draw it more easily than men can saidin.\n- **Weaves**: Specific patterns of the One Power for effects like Healing, Fireball, Shielding, Traveling (between ter'angreal gateways).\n- **Angreal/Saidin/Saidar**: Objects that amplify channeling ability; ter'angreal have various effects; sa'angreal are extremely powerful variants.\n\n**The Five Powers**\n- Earth, Fire, Air, Water, and Spirit (不及 Spirit)—some individuals have stronger affinities for certain Powers.\n\n**Major Characters**\n- **Rand al'Thor**: Sheepherder from the Two Rivers, revealed as the Dragon Reborn. Slowly hardens through the series as he accepts his destiny.\n- **Egwene al'Vere**: Becomes Aes Sedai, eventually Amyrlin Seat. From Rand's village, learns from the Aiel Wise Ones.\n- **Nynaeve al'Meara**: Powerful Healing channeler, initially a Wisdom in Emond's Field, later Aes Sedai.\n- **Elayne Trakand**: Daughter-Heir of Andor, Rand's lover, co-ruler of Andor.\n- **Perrin Aybara**: Wolfbrother with empathic/telepathic wolf connections, marries Faile Bashere.\n- **Mat Cauthon**: Lucky gambler, acquires the Foxhead medallion (anti-channeling), becomes a military genius, marries Tuon.\n- **Moiraine Damodred & Lan Mandragoran**: Aes Sedai and her Warder from the White Tower who find the Dragon Reborn. Moiraine is sequestered for much of the series.\n- **Siuan Sanche**: Amyrlin Seat deposed by the Tower coup, works with the Salidar Aes Sedai faction.\n- **Logain Ablar**: Captured male channeler who claimed to be the Dragon, later joins the Black Tower.\n- **Tuon Athaem Kore Paendrag**: Seanchan Empress's daughter, marries Mat.\n- **Egwene's Tower**: The rebel Amyrlin Seat's faction in Salidar.\n\n**The Land**\nThe Westlands (main continent) includes Andor (capital Caemlyn), Tear (Stone of Tear holds Callandor), Illian, Cairhien, the Borderlands (Shienar, Kandor, Arafel, Saldaea), the Aiel Waste, the Blight (wilderness at the Dark One's prison), and the Seanchan Empire.\n\n**Key Plot Points**\n- The Eye of the World (book 1): Rand, Mat, Perrin escape the Blight with the Horn of Valere.\n- The Great Hunt of the Horn (book 2): Hunt for Horn, introduction of the Seanchan.\n- The Dragon Reborn (book 3): Rand claims Callandor in the Stone of Tear.\n- The Shadow Rising (book 4): Aiel War, Rand learns his heritage, the Forsaken freed.\n- Fires of Heaven (book 5): Rhuidean, Aiel history revealed.\n- Lord of Chaos (book 6): Dumai's Wells, Aes Sedai captured, Black Tower founded.\n- A Crown of Swords (book 7), Winter's Heart (book 8), Crossroads of Twilight (book 9).\n- Knife of Dreams (book 10): Egwene becomes Amyrlin, Mat marries Tuon.\n- The Gathering Storm (book 11), Towers of Midnight (book 12): Sanderson's completion begins.\n- A Memory of Light (book 14): Tarmon Gai'don, Rand's final confrontation.\n\n**Themes**\nTa'veren (people so central to the Pattern that reality bends around them), gender dynamics, cyclical history, destiny vs. free will, leadership's cost, trust and betrayal, power and corruption.\n\nThe series is celebrated for its scope, magic system, and world-building, though criticized for pacing in mid-books and certain character treatment (especially women's portrayal).",

Let me provide detailed information about them.\n\nThe Sea Folk (formally the Atha'an Miere) are a seafaring people who control much of the world's maritime trade. Key facts:\n\n1. **Name**: Atha'an Miere (Children of the Sea), commonly called Sea Folk or Sea Women\n2. **Appearance**: Dark skin, often with sun-bleached hair, very tall and slender\n3. **Trading Ships**: They operate a vast fleet of merchant vessels, dominating sea trade between nations\n4. **Sea Folk Wives**: Their version of Aes Sedai, called Windfinders, who can channel and control weather for sailing\n5. **Social Structure**: Clans led by Mistress of the Ships (chief ruler), with complex hierarchies\n6. **Marriage and Gender**: Matriarchal society - property and titles pass through women, not men\n7. **First Appearance**: Introduced in The Great Hunt (Book 2)\n8. **Notable Characters** - Joline Mazaathor (Windfinder to the Amyrlin Seat), Tesaria, Weselle, Bethamin, etc.\n9. **Rhuidean Vision**: In book 4, Rand sees their ancestors who were Da'shain Aiel who refused to take up arms when others attacked - they fled to the sea\n10. **Ter'angreal**: They use a special ter'angreal to speak with ships at sea (similar to the Oath Rod)\n11. **Political Role**: In later books, they become more involved in mainland politics\n12. **Mat and Tuon**: The Sea Folk play a role in Mat's storyline, particularly with his fleet and negotiations with Tuon\n\nThis is an important omission that I should correct.",

        "text": "You're right—I missed them. The **Atha'an Miere** (Children of the Sea), commonly called the **Sea Folk**, are a seafaring civilization crucial to the world's maritime trade.\n\n**Origins & Appearance**\nThey descended from Da'shain Aiel who, during the Breaking, chose not to take up arms when attacked. They fled to the sea rather than fight. They have dark skin, are tall and slender, often with sun-bleached hair.\n\n**Society**\n- **Matriarchal**: Titles, property, and ships pass through women, not men\n- **Clan structure**: Ruled by the Mistress of the Ships (overall leader), with individual ships having their own hierarchies\n- **Wives vs. husbands**: Women hold power; men serve aboard ships\n\n**Windfinders**\nTheir female channelers are called **Windfinders** (Sea Folk wives who channel). They're essential for navigating and controlling weather at sea. They serve as sorceresses aboard trading vessels, commanding high prices for their services.\n\n**Key Aspects**\n- Dominate global sea trade with their vast merchant fleet\n- Use a ter'angreal similar to the Oath Rod to communicate between ships at sea\n- First appear in *The Great Hunt* when Rand meets them\n- Later in the series, Windfinders serve the White Tower and become politically involved on the mainland\n- **Egeanin** is a Sea Folk woman who becomes a notable character, eventually working against the Seanchan\n\n**Notable Windfinders**: Joline Mazaathor (Windfinder to the Amyrlin Seat), Tesaria, and Bethamin.\n\nTheir pacifist origins and evolution into a powerful trading empire are an interesting thread in the world's history.",

Let me think about what I might have missed about the Sea Folk specifically:\n\n1. **Sea Folk and the Sea Folk Ships**:\n- They have massive fleets of trading ships\n- Their ships are called \"clipper ships\" or something similar in the books\n- They have a unique social structure where women control everything\n- They have a special relationship with the water and are excellent swimmers\n\n2. **Cultural Practices**:\n- They have a custom of \"the first year's trade\" or something similar\n- Their naming conventions\n- Their views on outsiders\n- They're extremely practical and businesslike\n\n3. **Specific characters I should mention**- Actually, there was an important Sea Folk character: **Reanne Corly** (also called Reyae), who was an important Windfinder\n- Joline Mazaathor Tesoria - Windfinder to the White Tower\n- They have a special bond with the Oath Rod equivalent they use\n\n4. **Their role in the series**:\n- They controlled much of the sea trade- They had a special ter'angreal for communication\n- They were involved in the politics of the later books\n- They had a prophecy about the Dragon Reborn\n- They demanded a high price for their services\n\n5. **The Windfinder's unique position**:\n- Windfinders are the only women who can speak freely to the Mistress of the Ships\n- They can demand goods and services on the ships\n- They're highly prized\n\n6. **Sea Folk philosophy**:\n- They believe in \"what is done at sea is done\"\n- They have a very pragmatic worldview\n- They don't interfere in mainland affairs much\n\n7. **Their relationship with the Seanchan**:\n- The Sea Folk were historically at odds with the Seanchan\n- Some Sea Folk became damane (channelers on leashes) under Seanchan rule\n- This was a major point of conflict\n\n8. **Sea Folk trading practices**:\n\n\nTheir trading prowess is legendary, with a reputation for sharp negotiations and a complete monopoly on maritime commerce. They conduct exchanges through elaborate rituals involving gifts, negotiations, and strategic positioning. The \"wedding\" tradition between ships demonstrates their complex social customs, where ships symbolically \"marry\" at sea to establish new trading connections.",
